**  # F ruit-bearing crop plants have been domesticated from a widerange of wild plant species.
One of the hallmarks of fruit-crop  domestication has been an explosion in fruit shape variation (1, 2), and it is this variation that often determines the market of fruit-bearing crops.
Despite its historical and economic importance, the molecular basis for fruit shape variation is largely unknown.
Pear-shaped fruit is one of the most common recurring shape themes.
Although uncommon in the wild, pearshaped fruit can be found in modern varieties of tomatoes, eggplants, melons, squash, pears, and other fruit-bearing plants.
However, little is known about the ontology of pear-shaped fruit, except that the molecular events derailing the normal process of spherical growth apparently occur early in flower development (3).
Pear-shaped fruit possess several phenotypes that differ from those of wild-type fruit: whereas the wild types possess round shaped fruit with seeds distributed around the center of the fruit, pear-shaped fruit are elongated with conspicuous neck constrictions and seeds distributed asymmetrically toward one end of the fruit (4).
In early literature on tomato genetics, _ovate_ was described as a single recessive gene on chromosome 2 that is responsible for the pear-shaped tomato fruit traits (5–7).
Recent genetic analyses have further identified _ovate_ as a major quantitative trait (QTL) controlling pear-shaped fruit development in both tomato and eggplant (4, 8).
To shed light on the molecular basis and genetic lesion(s) involved in the creation of pear-shaped fruit, we have cloned the _ovate_ locus from tomato.
Protein annotation, overexpression studies, and the recessive nature of _ovate_ indicate that OVATE represents a previously uncharacterized class of negative regulatory proteins important in plant development.
**Materials and Methods**   **Plant Materials, Growth Conditions, and Floral Organ Measurements.
** Tomato plants were grown in greenhouses in Ithaca, NY.
Transgenic plants were generated as described (9).
To prepare samples for DNA or RNA extractions, leaf, flower, or fruit tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after harvests.
For measurements, 10 anthesis flowers from each transgenic or nontransgenic plant were collected.
The floral organs, i.e., sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, were separated from each    other and scanned.
The length of each organ was measured from the scanned image with SCION software (Scion, Frederick, MD).
**RNA Extraction, First-Stranded cDNA Synthesis, and RT-PCR.
** Total RNA from TA496 ( _Lycopersicon esculentum_ ) and TA503 ( _L._ _esculentum_ cv.
Yellow Pear) was extracted from leaf, flower, or fruit tissues with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen).
Superscript RNaseH� Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) was used to synthesize the first-stranded cDNA with the B24 primer (5�-GAC TCG AGT CGA CAT CGA (dT) 17 -3�).
Full-length cDNA was amplified by PCR from the first-stranded cDNA with primers B25 (5�-GAC TCG AGT CGA CAT CGA-3�) and OV5� (5�GCA GAG ACA AAA AGA ATG GGA A-3�) and subsequently cloned into the pCR2 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
**5** � **and 3** � **RACE.
** 3� RACE was used to amplify _OVATE_ transcripts with primers B25 and RT-CDS6-5� (5�-CAA TCA AGC AAT CCA GAC CA-3�).
The 5� RACE system (Invitrogen) was used to determine the initial _OVATE_ transcription.
The first-stranded cDNA was synthesized as described above except that the primer used was CDS6-5�-1 (5�-GGA GGT TCT TCT ACT ACT ACC TA-3�).
5� RACE PCR primers were AAP (Invitrogen) and CDS6-5�-2 (5�-CGC CTC AAC TAT CAC TCC AT-3�).
Nest PCR was performed with primers AUAP (Invitrogen) and CDS6-5�-3 (5�-CGA CGA TCT TCT ACC TTT TGA AGA-3�).
**Binary Constructs for Tomato Transformation.
*
*
To make a complementation construct, a genomic DNA fragment spanning from 2,000 bp upstream of the initial codon to 1,550 bp downstream of the termination codon of _ORF6_ was amplified by PCR from TA496 with primers CDS6- _Nhe_
I (5�-CAC TAG CTA GCC AAA CTT GCT GTG GCT GGA CAG AA-3�, underlined is the _Nhe_
I site) and CDS6- _Sal_ I (5�-GTA CGC GTC GAC CAT TTC TCG AGA TGC CTT TCC ACA-3�, underlined is the _Sal_ I site).
Restriction-digested PCR products were cloned into the pGPTV-Kan vector between the corresponding restriction sites (10).
For the overexpression construct, a genomic DNA fragment, spanning from the initial codon to the termination codon, was amplified by PCR from TA496 with primers CONS-CDS6_Nhe_ I-L (5�-TCT AGC TAG CAT GAT CTC CGT TGG GTG TTG TA-3�, underlined is the _Nhe_ I site), CONS-CDS6- _Kpn_ I-2 (5� TCG GGG TAC CAG GTG CTA ATC GTT ACG GTA-3�, underlined is the _Kpn_ I site).
The digested PCR products were cloned into the pPS1 vector behind the double cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35 _S_ promoters between the _Nhe_
I and _Kpn_
I sites.
The constructs and vectors were individually electroporated into _Agrobacterium tumefaciens_ strain LBA4404 (Invitrogen) and used for tomato transformation.
The presence of the transgenes was confirmed by PCR and Southern blots.

**Results**   **Genetic and Physical Fine Mapping of the OVATE Region.
**
We have previously identified a region which harbors a major QTL responsible for both fruit elongation and neck constriction of the _ovate_ phenotype around the molecular marker TG645 on tomato chromosome 2 (Fig.
1 _A_ ; ref. 4).
TG645 was used to screen several tomato bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries, which identified a BAC clone named BAC19 containing a 105-kb genomic DNA insert that covers the _ovate_ region (Fig. 1 _
A_ and _B_ ; ref. 3).
Sequencing of the BAC19 clone revealed 17 putative ORFs (Fig. 1 _C_ ; ref. 11).
On the bases of the BAC19 sequence, cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were developed and used to identify the two closest crossovers flanking the _ovate_ region, which further    **Fig.

Fruit at early, late, and mature developmental stages, respectively, from an inflorescence of a native transformant.   narrowed the _ovate_ locus to a 55-kb interval encompassing eight _ORFs_ (Fig. 1 _C_ ; ref. 3).
**Identification of OVATE Candidate Gene.
**
To identify the specific gene that causes the pear-shaped phenotype, DNA fragments that cover the corresponding 55-kb region were amplified by PCR from a wild-type (round-fruited) genotype (TA496, _L._ _esculentum_ ) and sequenced.
A comparison between this sequence and that of the same region derived from an _ovate_ genotype (TA493, _L. esculentum_ cv.
Heinz 1706, the original BAC sequence) revealed two SNPs and a 2-bp _in_ serted or _del_ eted nucleotide (indel; Fig.
1 _C_ ).
The indel and one of the SNPs were located in noncoding regions, whereas the other SNP, a G TA496 to-T TA493 nucleotide polymorphism in the second exon of _ORF6_ (Fig. 1 _D_ ), results in an early stop codon in the _ovate_ genotype, which leads to a 75-aa truncation in the C terminus of the predicted protein.
The occurrence of a premature stop codon, which would likely result in a partial or complete loss of function, is consistent with the observed allelic interactions at the _ovate_ locus; pear-shaped alleles are recessive or semirecessive to wild-type round-fruited alleles (4).
Thus, _ORF6_ was considered as a likely candidate for the _ovate_ gene.
Further evidence in support of this hypothesis came from sequencing _ORF6_ from several pear-shaped tomato varieties, including TA503 ( _L. esculentum_ cv.
Yellow Pear) (Fig. 2), LA791 ( _L. esculentum_ cv.
Longjohn), and LA0025.
All were revealed to possess the identical _ORF6_ sequence, including the premature stop codon, suggesting that these pear-shaped varieties have a common progenitor allele for _ORF6_ .
A homozygous recombinant line (TA1792; ref. 3), derived from the original mapping population (4), possesses a chimerical _ORF6_ as the result of a crossover in the only intron of _ORF6_ (Fig. 1 _D_ ).
The 5� regulatory sequence and the first exon are derived from a wild-type round-fruited genotype, whereas the second exon and downstream region is from the _ovate_ genotype.
TA1792 produced pear-shaped fruit (data not shown), further suggesting    Liu _et al_ .
PNAS � **October 1, 2002** � vol. 99
� no. 20 � **13303**   that the premature stop codon in the second exon of _ORF6_ is responsible for the _ovate_ phenotype.
**Complementation of the Pear-Shaped Fruit Phenotype by OVATE.
**
To verify that _ORF6_ is the _ovate_ gene, a genomic DNA fragment covering _ORF6_ and its 5� and 3� untranslated region was amplified from the wild-type round-fruited line (TA496) and cloned into the binary vector pGPTV-Kan (10).
In addition, an overexpression construct also was produced in which the _ORF6_ coding region from TA496 was cloned into the binary vector pPS1 behind the double CaMV-35 _S_ promoters in a sense orientation.
Both constructs, as well as the control vectors, were individually transformed into TA503 plants, which contain the _ovate_ allele and normally produce pear-shaped fruit.
Ten independent T 0 transformants were obtained in which the pear-shaped phenotype was converted to round or semi-round: the transgenes of three and seven lines were driven by native or 35 _S_ promoters, respectively.
Preanthesis flowers of the nativepromoter transformants showed phenotypes reminiscent of TA503: somewhat elongated ovaries with slight neck constrictions and locular cavities positioned asymmetrically toward one end of the fruit (Fig.
2 _A_ and _B_ ).
However, after anthesis, the fruit of these lines gradually became rounder until, at maturity, most of the fruit in a single inflorescence were round (Fig. 2 _E_ – _G_ ), with the locular cavities in the center of the fruit (Fig. 2 _C_ and _D_ ).
Only the last fruit to develop in the inflorescence showed slight pear-shaped phenotypes (Fig. 2 _G_ ).
In the overexpression lines, a complete rescue of pear-shaped fruit phenotypes was achieved before anthesis (Fig. 2 _
A_ and _B_ ).
These results clearly demonstrated that _ORF6_ complements both fruit elongation and fruit neck constriction phenotypes, indicating that it is the _ovate_ gene.
**Overexpression of OVATE Confers Abnormal Phenotypes to Tomato** **Plants.
**
In addition to producing round fruit, the 35 _S_ overexpression lines displayed a number of abnormal phenotypes, including exserted stigmas (Fig. 3 _
A_ and _B_ ), slower plant growth, and changed vegetative and floral architecture (Fig. 3 _C_ – _E_ ).
All floral organs of these overexpression lines were smaller than their nontransformant or native-promoter transformant counterparts (Fig. 3 _B_ ).
However, the sepals and the stamens were most affected and showed 30–60% more reduction as compared with the petals and pistils (Fig. 3 _B_ ).
In addition, slower plant growth and smaller compound-leaf size seem to correlate with the stronger overexpression lines (Fig. 3 _C_ and _D_ ).
In moderate and strong lines (Lines 2 and 3), leaflets became rounder, and serration became less apparent (Fig. 3 _E_ ).
These results suggest that OVATE is a suppressor of plant growth, and that the exserted stigma phenotype is caused by uneven suppression of different floral organ growth by overexpression of _ovate._
Overexpression of _ovate_ did not significantly affect male or female fertility, as, after manual selfing, all of the overexpression lines produced fruit with normal seed set (data not shown).
**OVATE Is Expressed in Reproductive Organs in Early Stages of Flower** **and Fruit Development.
** There are currently more than 150,000 tomato EST sequences in public databases (www.sgn. cornell.edu), a large proportion of which are derived from cDNA libraries made from developing flower and fruit RNAs.
A screen of these data revealed no ESTs with a match to _OVATE._
Moreover, _OVATE_ message was not detected through Northern blots with leaf, flower, or fruit RNAs of different developmental stages, suggesting that _OVATE_ is expressed at low levels during plant development.
Therefore, real-time PCR was applied to quantify _OVATE_ transcript levels in _ovate_ (TA503) and wild-type (TA496) plants.
As shown in Fig.
4, _OVATE_ is expressed primarily in reproductive organs and at an almost undetectable    **Fig.

level in vegetative tissues, including young leaves and shoots.
_OVATE_ transcripts can be detected in flowers 10 days before anthesis (DBA) and until 8 days after anthesis (DAA) in developing fruit, at which time _ovate_ transcript levels begin to decrease.

**OVATE Encodes a Previously Uncharacterized Class of Regulatory** **Genes Important for Plant Development.
**
The full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence of _OVATE_ was obtained through RT-PCR and 5� and 3� RACE.
Based on the sequence, _ovate_ is predicted to encode a 40.7-kDa hydrophilic protein with a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS; ref. 12), two putative Von Willebrand factor type C (VWFC) protein–protein interaction domains (13), and an �70-aa carboxyl-terminal domain conserved in tomato, _Arabidopsis_, and rice (Fig. 5 _A_ and _B_ ).
The premature termination in translation that occurs in the _ovate_ allele would eliminate most of this conserved domain (Fig. 5 _B_ and _C_ ), implicating its functional significance, and may account for the loss-of-function (recessive) phenotypes exhibited by the _ovate_ genotypes.
The unknown-functioned _OVATE_ homologues in other plant species also contain putative VWFC domains and NLSs in the unconserved region (J.L. and S.D.T., unpublished data).
**Discussion**   **OVATE Functions as a Plant-Growth Suppressor.
**
In the present study, we identified and cloned the fruit shape gene, _OVATE_, which determines the conversion of tomato fruit from round to pear shaped.
The morphological differences between these fruitshape schemes are conspicuous and complex (Fig. 2 _A_ – _D_, columns 1 and 2) and could be attributed to a well defined modulation of cell proliferation and cell differentiation in tomato fruit.
_
OVATE_ is apparently a key player in fueling such transition.
Early genetic studies indicated that a recessive mutation in _ovate_ is responsible for pear-shaped fruit phenotype in tomato (5–7).
Sequence comparisons of _OVATE_ alleles indicated that all tested pear-shaped varieties of tomato share the same non-sense mutation that causes truncation of the predicted protein and could account for the loss-of-function (recessive) nature of these alleles (data not shown).
The homozygous recombinant line,    TA1792, has a chimerical _OVATE_ allele and produced pearshaped fruit, indicating that the mutation in the second exon from the pear-shaped allele is sufficient for fruit shape conversion (Fig.
1 _D_ ; see _Results_ ).
Taken together, these results indicate that the wild-type form of OVATE prevents pear-shaped fruit formation.
As the generation of a pear-shaped fruit could be simply considered as a consequence of an outgrowth of the fruit neck region from a round fruit, OVATE might act as a growth suppressor in the fruit neck region.
A DNA fragment encompassing the wild-type round-fruited allele of _OVATE_ could largely rescue the fruit phenotype of a pear-shaped tomato line, TA503, suggesting that OVATE is sufficient to suppress fruit neck outgrowth (Fig. 2).
Transgenic and ectopic overexpression of _OVATE_ not only completely restored round fruit phenotype to the pear-shaped line (Fig. 2 _
A_ – _C_ ; column 4), but it also led to growth repression and changed architecture of both vegetative and reproductive organs (Fig. 3).
Interestingly, the fruit size and seed development were not affected by constitutive expression of _OVATE_ in the strong overexpression lines (Fig. 2; J.L. and S.D.T., unpublished data), indicating that different organs respond differently to OVATE.
This result also suggests that the growth suppression by OVATE is unlikely caused by a nonspecific toxic effect of OVATE on basic cellular processes, as we would expect to see, if this is correct, uniform responses of all organs to overexpressed _OVATE_ .
In native-promoter transgenic lines, the early fruit were better complemented by _OVATE_ than the late fruit from a single inflorescence of a pear-shaped line (Fig. 2 _E_ – _G_ ), suggesting that _OVATE_ is not only regulated at transcriptional levels but is also regulated by developmental cues.
Further studies on spatial expression patterns of _OVATE_ will provide more insight into the relation of _OVATE_ expression and its function.
**OVATE Might Represent a Previously Uncharacterized Class of Regu-** **latory Genes of Plant Growth.
** _OVATE_ encodes a protein that has no matches to any known functions in databases.
Sequence alignments and database searches revealed that OVATE contains a bipartite NLS, protein–protein interaction domains, and a conserved Cterminal domain of the plant systems.
OVATE and its putative homologs in tomato and other plant species share sequence similarity only in this conserved C-terminal domain (Fig. 5 _B_ and _C_ ).
The non-sense mutation in the tested pear-shaped _ovate_ alleles abolishes most of the conserved domain of the predicted protein (Figs. 1 _D_ and 5 _C_ ; J.L. and S.D.T., unpublished data).
However, in the nonconserved regions, the OVATE homologs also possess bipartite NLSs and�or the VWFC domains (J.L. and S.D.T., unpublished data), implicating the importance of the structural arrangements of these genes.
As _OVATE_ is predicted to encode a hydrophilic protein with a putative nuclear localization (Fig. 5 _A_ and _B_ ) and have a broad influence on plant development, it might represent a previously uncharacterized class of regulatory gene family important for plant development.
Further genetic and biochemical studies of the function of these genes in tomato and other plant species will provide a better generalization for their roles in plant development.
**Modulation of a Few Major Regulatory Genes Can Fuel Dramatic** **Morphological Changes During Evolution and Domestication.
**
Fruit of wild plant species are usually small and round in shape, which facilitates seed distributions by wild animals.
Domestication has greatly increased the diversities of fruit shape and size of fruit crop plants in accompaniment with other changes, such as overall physiologic responses and adaptations to natural environments.
Recently, a theory has emerged that major morphological changes during evolution and domestication can be attributable    Liu _et al_ .
PNAS � **October 1, 2002** � vol. 99
� no. 20 � **13305**   to a few major regulatory genes of large effects rather than to many genes, each of which contributes a small effect to the changes (14).
For instance, a non-sense mutation in _BoCAL_ is responsible for the domestication of cauliflower plants (15); the _TB1_ gene of maize is a key regulatory gene that controls the morphological transition of wild maize species to modern cultivated maize (16).
In the present study, we demonstrate that a non-sense mutation in a single gene, _OVATE_, is sufficient for the transition of   1.
