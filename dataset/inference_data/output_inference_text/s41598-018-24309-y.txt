**   Sunlight provides the energy of photosynthesis in sessile plants and also plays an essential role in regulation of their entire life cycle.
However, ultraviolet-B (UV-B) light, as an indispensible component of sunlight, can retard plant growth by causing DNA damage, generating reactive oxygen species, and inhibiting photosynthesis [1] .
To survive in sunlight, plants have to evolve the specific mechanisms perceiving and responding to the UV-B radiation
[2][,][3] .
Recent studies revealed that UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8 (UVR8) protein was responsible for UV-B perception and signal transduction in _Arabidopsis_
[1][,][4][–][6] .
The UVR8 gene was first identified in a mutation screen for UV-sensitive plants and the _uvr8_ mutant was hypersensitive to UV-B radiation
[7] .
The abolished UV acclimation of _uvr8_ mutant is caused by failure of UV-induced expression of defense genes involved in UV damage repairment and UV protection, such as chalcone synthase (CHS) gene which is the committing enzyme for UV-absorptive flavonoid and anthocyanin biosynthesis
[7][,][8] .
Further investigations revealed that the transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) was a fundamental factor of UV signal pathway [9][–][11] and UVR8 regulated _HY5_ expression through physical association with chromatin in its promoter region [8] .

UVR8 forms homodimers in cytoplasm and their instant monomerization, which requires two tryptophan residues serving as the UV-B chromophore, can be activated by UV-B radiation [2][,][4][,][6][,][13] .
The monomerized UVR8  .
proteins are translocated from cytoplasm to the nucleus for fulfilling its function and signal transduction
[14][,][15] UVR8 protein interacts with multifunctional E3 ligase CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) protein, a key regulator of light signaling, which is also involved in response to UV-B
[14][,][16][–][19] .
In the dark, COP1 interacts with DAMAGED DNA BINDING PROTEIN 1 (DDB1) and CULLIN4 (CUL4) to form the super complex of CUL4-DDB1-COP1-SPA E3 ligase which inhibits the photomorphogenesis by targeting HY5 for degradation.
Under UV-B radiation, COP1-SPA complex disassociates from CUL4-DDB1 and interacts with monomerized UVR8 [20] to form UVR8-COP1-SPA complex which plays a positive role in stabilizing HY5 protein and its activity [21] .
It appears that UVR8 modulates plant response to UV-B through regulating key transcription factor HY5 at both transcriptional and posttranslational level.
DDB1 was first demonstrated to be involved in damaged DNA repair, since it binds to the UV-induced DNA lesions and mediates nucleotide excision repair processes [22] .
In Arabidopsis, DDB1 is associated with CUL4 and additional substrate receptor proteins including COP1 to form CUL4-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL4) which is required for many cellular processes [23][–][25] .
In tomato ( _Solanum lycopersicum_ ), CUL4-DDB1 complex was proved to participate in plastid development and secondary metabolism [26][–][28], epigenetic regulation [29], and stress response [30][–][32] .
The mutant _high pigment -1_ ( _hp1_ ), which is caused by a point mutation in tomato _DDB1_ ( _SlDDB1_ ) gene, displays the enhanced fruit nutrient contents resulting from the increased plastid (chloroplast) numbers and sizes in fruit cells
[26] .
Genetic suppression of tomato _CUL4_ ( _SlCUL4_ ) and _SlDDB1_ genes resulted in the phenocopy of the _hp1_ mutant [27] .
These studies suggested that CUL-DDB1 complex plays a crucial role in plastid development in tomato.
A transcription factor GOLD2-LIKE (SlGLK2), which determines plastid and chlorophyll levels by enhancing photosynthesis gene expression and chloroplast development
[33][–][35], is a target of CRL4 ubiquitin E3 ligase
[36] .
The degradation of SlGLK2 protein is impaired in the _hp1_ mutant and _SlCUL4_ silencing plants [28] .
Although the homologous genes of Arabidopsis _UVR8_ were cloned in several plant species including Arabidopsis, _Populus euphratica_
[37], apple
[38], grape berry [39], grapevine [40], radish sprouts [41], and _Chlamydomonas rein-_ _hardtii_
[42], little is known about characterization of tomato _UVR8_ ( _SlUVR8_ ) gene.
In this study, we cloned _SlUVR8_ gene and confirmed its conserved role in response to UV-B radiation.
In addition, our results also revealed that SlUVR8 could mediate fruit plastid development under UV-B radiation, possibly through regulating the accumulation of transcription factor SlGLK2.

We BLAST in tomato ( _Solanum lycopersicum_ ) genome sequence database
[(https://sgn.cornell.edu/organism/Solanum_lycopersicum/genome) with Arabidopsis UVR8 protein sequence](https://sgn.cornell.edu/organism/Solanum_lycopersicum/genome) and got only one positive hit (Solyc05g018620), termed as _SlUVR8_, which suggested that the tomato genome contained only one homologous gene of _UVR8_ .
We cloned the gene by RT-PCR and the encoding protein shared 79% identities with Arabidopsis UVR8 (Supplemental Fig. 1).
SlUVR8 also contains multiple repeated RCC1 domains, similar to UVR8 protein in Arabidopsis.
The phylogenetic analysis indicated that SlUVR8 shared the best amino acid identity with _
Solanum tuberosum_ UVR8 (StUVR8) (Supplemental Fig. 2).
The _SlUVR8_ gene was expressed constitutively in all the organs of tomato plants we tested.
The expression levels in the leaves and flowers were apparently higher than that in other tissues, as indicated by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis (Fig. 1A).
To check the sub-cellular localization of SlUVR8 protein, the gene of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) was fused with _SlUVR8_ gene and GFP-SlUVR8 construct was transformed in protoplasts of tobacco leaves.
The transformed protoplasts were observed by confocal microscope.
As shown in Fig.
1B, GFP-SlUVR8 proteins were localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm simultaneously, similar to the sub-cellular localization of Arabidopsis UVR8 [14][,][15] .
Western-blot analysis indicated the both GFP and GFP-SlUVR8 were really expressed in the transformed protoplasts (Fig. 1C).
**SlUVR8 is required for tomato acclimation to UV-B radiation.
**
To study the function of _SlUVR8_ -encoded protein and to explore its physiological role in UV-B response, two different kinds of transgenic tomato lines were generated by _Agrobacterium tumefaciens_ -mediated transformation.
One was the repression lines by using RNA interference (SlUVR8Ri), expressing _SlUVR8_ -derived inverted-repeat sequences under the direction of the CaMV 35S promoter.
The other was over-expression lines of _SlUVR8_ (SlUVR8OE), also driven by 35S promoter.
After screening the T0 generation plants with the quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays of _SlUVR8_ expression, three independent lines were chosen for SlUVR8Ri (-1, -2, and -3) and SlUVR8OE (-1, -2, and -3), respectively.
The homolozygous plants for each line were obtained in T2 generation.
As validated by qRT-PCR, _SlUVR8_ expression were significantly decreased in SlUVR8Ri lines (Fig.
2A) and remarkably increased in SlUVR8OE lines (Fig.
2B) compared to wild type (WT) plants.
The growth and development of transgenic plants were indistinguishable from WT plants in absence of UV-B light (Fig. 2C).
After additional treatment with UV-B radiation for 1 week, however, SlUVR8Ri plants showed hypersensitive phenotypes including retarded growth, curly and bleached leaves, and even premature cell death (Fig.
2C) while SlUVR8OE plants displayed much less bleached leaves than WT plants (Fig.
2C and D).
In addition, anthocyanin and chlorophyll accumulation were significiantly reduced in the leaves of SlUVR8Ri plants after UV-B treatment (Fig.
3A and B).
However, SlUVR8OE plants enhanced accumulation of anthocyanin and chlorophyll in leaves (Fig.
3A and B).
Moreover, qRT-PCR assays indicated that expression of tomato _HY5_ ( _SlHY5_ ), as well as _CHS_ ( _SlCHS_ ) gene, was down-regulated in SlUVR8Ri plants and up-regulated SlUVR8OE plants (Fig. 3C) compared with WT.
Together, these results demonstrated that _
SlUVR8_ was required for tomato   SCIEnTIFIC

Over-expression of SlUVR8 could increase plant tolerance to UV-B stress by up-regulating _SlHY5_ expression and enhancing anthocyanin accumulation.

We grew the transgenic lines and WT plants in the outdoor fields, as described in “Materials and Methods”, with exposure to the natural sunlight.
The SlUVR8Ri plants displayed normal growth without any phenotypes of hypersensitivity to UV radiation (data not shown).
However, the SlUVR8Ri plants had pale green immature fruits (Fig. 4A).
In contrast, SlUVR8OE plants had darker green fruits compared to WT plants (Fig. 4A).
Accordingly, ripe fruits expressing _SlUVR8_ had a 20% increase in chlorophyll content (Fig. 4B) and a 25% increase in carotenoids (Lycopene and β-Carotene) contents (Fig. 4D), as compared with WT fruits.
In addition, starch accumulation were boosted in fruits of SlUVR8OE plants but reduced in SlUVR8Ri plants (Fig. 4E).
However, the anthocyanin contents in fruits were very low and indistinguishable between WT and transgenic fruits (Fig. 4C).
The previous studies revealed that low accumulation of flavonoids (including anthocyanins) in tomato fruits was caused by low expression of _chalcone isomerase_ ( _CHI_ ) gene
[43] and other genes [44] required for anthocyanin biosynthesis.
Our results indicated that overexpression of _SlUVR8_ had no apparent effect on anthocyanin accumulation in tomato fruits, although _SlHY5_ expression was also up-regulated in fruits of SlUVR8OE plants (Supplemental Fig. 3).
Meanwhile, we investigated chloroplast compartment sizes in pericarp cells of mature green fruits from WT and transgenic plants.
The results indicated that plastid number per cell showed no substantial difference between WT and transgenic plants (Table 1), but plastid size (plastid plan area) was altered significantly (Table 1 and Fig.
5A).
Larger chloroplasts were developed in fruit pericarp cells of SlUVR8OE plants while smaller chloroplast were displayed in SlUVR8Ri plants, as observed by optical microscope (Fig.
5A) and transmission electron microscope (Fig. 5B).
The quantitative measurements confirmed our observations (Table 1).
These results revealed that SlUVR8 could influence chloroplast size but not chloroplast number in tomato fruits.

bigger starch grains were observed in chloroplasts from SlUVR8OE fruits while SlUVR8Ri fruits showed on obvious starch grains, as indicated by note “S” in Fig.
5B, in chloroplasts.
This observation was consistent with our previous quantitative measurements of total starch content (Fig. 4D).
It was noteworthy that we observed much less thylakoid stacks (grana) in the chloroplasts of SlUVR8Ri plants than in WT and SlUVR8OE plants (Fig. 5B), which implied that thylakoid membrane or photosynthesis apparatus in SlUVR8Ri plants might be damaged by solar UV radiation.
**SlUVR8 enhances the accumulation of transcriptional factor SlGLK2 under UV-B radiation.
** Tomato _GOLDEN2-LIKE_ ( _GLK_ ) transcription factor _SlGLK2_ determines chlorophyll accumulation and chloroplast development in fruits through enhancing photosynthesis gene expression [28][,][33][,][34] .
Therefore, we checked the SlGLK2 protein abundance in the fruits of transgenic plants grown under sunlight in open fields by using a SlGLK2-specific antibody which doesn’t recognize SlGLK1 [28] .
As shown in Fig.
6A, SlGLK2 proteins were over-accumulated in SlUVR8OE plants but less accumulated in SlUVR8Ri plants grown under sunlight.
In addition, UV-B radiation could enhance the accumulation of SlGLK2 in fruits of WT plants grown in chamber with white light (Fig. 6B).
These results indicated that _SlUVR8_ might affect chloroplast development through targeting transcription factor SlGLK2.
Next, the qRT-PCR assays indicated that UV-B could increase the mRNA levels of _SlGLK2_ gene in WT fruits (Fig. 6C).
It was noteworthy that UV-B radiation could increase SlGLK2 protein abundance by almost 7 times while mRNA level of SlGLK2 gene was increased by only 3 times (Fig.
6B and C).
These results suggested that there possibly was a post-translational regulation in UV-B enhanced SlGLK2 accumulation.
Also, _SlGLK2_ expression was increased in fruits of SlUVR8OE plants but decreased in fruits of SlUVR8Ri plants (Fig.
6D).
We also randomly selected two SlGLK2-targeted genes ( _SlPsaL_ and _SlPsbQ_ ), which encode photosystem I subunit L and photosystem II subunit Q respectively, and checked their expression in fruits of transgenic plants (Fig. 6D).
The results indicated that over-expression of _SlUVR8_ could increase the expression of transcriptional factor _SlGLK2_ and its target genes, while silencing of _SlUVR8_ led to suppression of _SlGLK2_ and its target genes in fruits, when plants were exposed to the sunlight.
Since _SlGLK2_ was also expressed in leaves [33][,][34], we also checked its expression in leaves of transgenic plants with or without UV-B treatment.
The qRT-PCR assays indicated that, when plants were cultured in indoor   SCIEnTIFIC

chamber with white light, _SlUVR8_ had no apparent effect on expression of _SlGLK2_ and its target genes (Fig. 7A).
However, after UV-B treatment, _SlGLK2_ expression was significantly increased in WT and SlUVR8OE leaves but not in SlUVR8Ri leaves.
In addition, the expression of the target gene _SlPsaL_ and _SlPsbQ_ showed no obvious difference under white light but was suppressed severely after UV-B treatment in the leaves of SlUVR8Ri plants compared with WT and SlUVR8OE plants (Fig. 7A).
These results confirmed that _
SlUVR8_ was required for UVB-enhanced expression of _SlGLK2_ and its target genes.
We also checked the expression of _SlGLK1_ gene which was expressed only in leaves but not in fruits [33][,][34] .
The qRT-PCR analysis indicated that UV-B radiation, as well as _SlUVR8_ expression, had no significant effect _SlGLK1_ expression in leaves (Fig. 7B).

Here, we isolated tomato _SlUVR8_ gene and identified its functions in plant’s adaptation to UV-B radiation.
Transgenic evidences suggested overexpression of _SlUVR8_ increased plant tolerance whereas silencing _SlUVR8_ gene led to the hypersensitivity to UV-B stress (Fig. 2).
In accordance with the previous studies in Arabidopsis, UV-B-induced _HY5_ and _CHS_ expression, as well as anthocyanin accumulation, were impaired in SlUVR8Ri plants but were enhanced in SlUVR8OE plants compared to WT (Fig. 3).
These results demonstrated that SlUVR8 played an essential role of orchestrating expression of key UV-responsive genes (such as _SlHY5_ and _SlCHS_ ) and accumulating UV-absorptive compounds with sunscreen functions of protecting plants from UV damage.
Sunlight provides energy for photosynthesis of chloroplast.
However, solar UV radiation could damage photosynthesis and chloroplasts as well [45] .
Numerous studies revealed that photosynthetic apparatus was susceptible to damage caused by UV-B
[46][–][50] .
The adverse effects from enhanced UV-B radiation on chloroplasts include but not limited to loss in integrity of the thylakoid membranes [51], impaired activity of photosystem II (PSII)
[52][,][53], enhanced protein degradation
[50], inhibited carbon fixation [54] and reduced content of starch and chlorophyll
[53][,][55]
.
Therefore, plants must employ some strategies or mechanisms, some of which remain to be elucidated yet, to respond to these problems and to maintain photosynthesis and chloroplast functions.
A few studies suggested that UVR8 is required for maintaining the photosynthesis efficiency under enhanced UV-B radiation in Arabidopsis [49][,][50] .
The underlying mechanism, however, has not been revealed yet.
In our work, we proved that _SlUVR8_ promote chloroplast development in tomato fruits when plants were grown in outdoor fields and exposed to natural sunlight (Fig. 4).
Silencing _SlUVR8_ caused some developmental issues in fruits including reduced size of chloroplasts and decreased contents of chlorophyll and starch, while overexpresssion of _SlUVR8_ led to larger chloroplasts and increased contents of chlorophyll and starch (Fig. 5).
The previous studies revealed that low accumulation of flavonoids (including anthocyanins) in tomato fruits resulted from low expression of _chalcone isomerase_ ( _CHI_ ) gene
[43] and other genes [44] required for anthocyanin biosynthesis.
Our results also showed that the anthocyanin contents in fruits were very low and indistinguishable between WT and transgenic fruits (Fig. 4C).
It is conceivable that deficiency of anthocyanins was not responsible for chloroplast abnormality in fruit cells from SlUVR8Ri plants.
In our case, SlUVR8 might play another role in affecting chloroplast development of tomato fruits rather than its role in accumulating UV-absorbing compounds.
Therefore, we speculated that SlUVR8 could enhance chloroplast development, facilitate the recycling of damaged chloroplasts, and thereby contribute to maintain photosynthesis under UV-B stress.
In tomato, silencing _SlHY5_ also caused abnormalities in both organization and abundance of thylakoids [26] .
However, no reports yet showed that overexpression of _SlHY5_ could lead to larger chloroplasts and high pigment of fruits in tomato.
Therefore, we surmise that other genes are also involved in the UVR8-mediated chloroplast development.
Our results disclosed that UV-B could enhance accumulation of SlGLK2, which was a key regulator of fruit chloroplast development
[33][,][34], and the UVB-enhanced SlGLK2 accumulation was dependent on _SlUVR8_ gene.
Several studies demonstrated that _SlGLK2_ influenced chloroplast development and chlorophyll level by increasing fruit photosynthesis and chloroplast gene expression [33][,][34] .

and carotenoids were elevated in fruits of _SlGLK2_ overexpression plants.
Our results showed that more chlorophyll, starch, and carotenoids were accumulated in fruits of SlUVR8OE plants (Fig. 4), similar to the phenotypes of fruits expressing _SlGLK2_ .
In addition, our results indicated that SlGLK2 proteins were over-accumulated in SlUVR8OE fruits but less-accumulated in SlUVR8Ri fruits under sunlight (Fig. 6).
Further studies revealed that expression of _SlGLK2_ and its randomly-selected target genes were elevated in SlUVR8OE plants under UV-B radiation (Figs 6 and 7).
Silencing _SlUVR8_ abolish UVB-induced expression of _SlGLK2_ and its target gene (Figs 6 and 7).
These results suggested that _SlUVR8_ gene is required for UVB-enhanced _SlGLK2_ expression.
Therefore, we proposed an unknown pathway that photoreceptor _UVR8_ promote chloroplast development in tomato under UV-B stress by enhancing accumulation of SlGLK2.
Of course, we can’t exclude the role of _SlHY5_ in UV-mediated chloroplast development
[26] .
A study about the root greening in Arabidopsis [56] showed that _GLK2_ could induce the accumulation of HY5 and combination of _GLK2_ and _HY5_ mediated the coordinated expression of many key genes of chloroplast biogenesis.
This study might shed some light on the mechanism that both _SlHY5_ and _SlGLK2_ are possibly required for UVB-mediated chloroplast development.
The previous study showed that expression of _GLK2_ was also responsive to photooxidative chloroplast damage and retrograde signals from plastid in Arabidopsis
[57], indicating that _GLK2_ might play an additional role in adjusting photosynthetic capacity in changing environmental conditions.
It will be interesting to check whether silencing _SlGLK2_ alone could affect UVB-mediated chloroplast development and plant response to UV-B stress in further investigations.

In Arabidopsis, transcription factor _HY5_ is regulated by _UVR8_ at both transcriptional and post-translational levels [8][,][17][,][21] .
Here, our immunoblot analysis showed that UV-B radiation could increase SlGLK2 protein abundance by about 7 times while mRNA level of _SlGLK2_ gene was increased by only 3 times, as compared with untreated condition (Fig.
6B and C).
These results suggested that a post-translational modification, which requires further studies, might exist in this case.
In Arabidopsis, UVR8 were associated with chromatin in the region of the _HY5_ promoter and regulate _HY5_ transcription [8][,][58][,][59] .
However, a recent study [60] indicated that UVR8 didn’t bind to chromatin _in vivo_ or _in vitro_ , possibly because of lacking critical histone- and DNA-interaction residues.
Therefore, the exact mechanism of _UVR8_ regulating transcription remains controversial and elusive.
In our study, there is   SCIEnTIFIC

Therefore, we can’t exclude the possibility that SlUVR8 might regulate _SlGLK2_ gene expression through another transcription factor or proteins.
Further investigations are needed to validate our speculations and figure out the mysteries.
Together, we revealed that _
SlUVR8_ played a conserved role in plant acclimate to UV-B stress.
Besides, our results indicated that _SlUVR8_ mediated the fruit chloroplast development by enhancing accumulation of transcription factor SlGLK2.
Moreover, manipulation of _SlUVR8_ level represents a new option to enhance both tolerance to UV-B stress and nutrient values of tomato fruits, especially when plants were grown in outdoor fields with intense sunlight.
**Materials and Methods** **Plant Materials and Growth Conditions.
** Tomato ( _Solanum lycopersicum_ )
cv Ailsa Craig (LA2838A) were acquired from the Tomato Genetics Resource Center (UC Davis, USA).
Tomato plants were grown under artificial conditions (22–28 °C, 16 h light and 8 h dark) for several weeks and then transplanted into the outdoor field (located at the suburbs of Chengdu, China) for 4 months (from May to August).
During this time, the maximum value of UV-B irradiance at noon (1 p.m.) is 9.5 μmol/m [2] /s and the minimum value is 4.3 μmol/m
[2] /s, as measured by TBQ-ZW-2 UV-B (280–320 nm) light meter (Shanghai Minyin Electrics co., Ltd, China).
For photomorphogenic UV-B treatment, seedlings were grown under white light (photoperiod: 16 h light and 8 h dark) supplemented with Philips TL20W/01RS narrowband UV-B tubes (23 μmol/m [2] /s) for 12 hours per day.
**Generation of transgenic tomato.
**
The _Agrobacterium_ EHA105 strains containing vectors pBI121- _SlUVR8_ or pBI121- _SlUVR8_               - _RNAi_ were used to transform tomato cv Ailsa Craig by using _Agrobacterium_ _tumefaciens_ -mediated transformation
[61] .
Primary transformants (T0) and their offspring were cultivated under the artificial conditions for 4 weeks and then transplanted into the outdoor field (located at the suburbs of Chengdu, China).
The T-DNA insertions of transgenic plants were identified by PCR using _NPTII_ -specific primers and the expression of _SlUVR8_ gene was validated by real-time RT-PCR using _SlUVR8_ -specific primers.
Three independent transgenic lines were used for phenotypic and molecular analysis.
**Quantitative RT-PCR analysis.
** Total RNAs were isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen).
The genomic DNAs in total RNAs were erased and first-strand cDNAs were synthesized with oligo-dT(18T) primers by using cDNA Synthesis kit, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (TransGen, Beijing, China).
Quantitative PCR was conducted on the ABI StepOnePlus PCR System by using the TransStart Green qPCR SuperMix (TransGen).
Gene expression was normalized by the expression of _UBI3_ gene.
All the primers used are listed in Table S1.
**Subcellular localization analysis.
**
The coding sequence of the _SlUVR8_ gene was cloned into the expression vector pART27-mcs:GFP and generated the pART27- GFP-SlUVR8 construct.
Plasmid vectors pART27-GFP-SlUVR8 and pART27-GFP were introduced into protoplasts of tobacco ( _Nicotiana benthami-_ _ana_ ) according to the methods described previously [62][,][63] .
After incubation at 25 °C for 12–16 h, protoplasts were observed under a Leica TCS SPII confocal microscope using 488 and 633 nm excitation wavelengths and three-channel measurement of emission: 435 nm (blue/DAPI), 522 nm (green/GFP) and 680 nm (red/ chlorophyll).
**Protein extraction and immunoblot analysis.
**
Tissue was ground in liquid N 2 and was treated in boil water for 5 min with SDS-PAGE loading buffer to extract total proteins.
Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously [64] .
The SlGLK2-specific antibodies recognized the SlGLK2 N-terminal unique sequence (synthetic peptide SSSLSYKNERENYD, 5–18), but not SlGLK1 protein, as described in the previous study
[28] .
The secondary antibody Goat-anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were purchased from Hangzhou HuaAn Biotechnology Co., Ltd.   **Plastid Analysis and Transmission Electron Microscopy.
**
The fruit tissues used for plastid analysis were harvested from plants grown in outside open fields and processed as previously reported [65] .
In brief, the fruit pericarp tissues were immersed in 3.5% glutaraldehyde for 1 hour at least, then incubated in 0.1 M Na 2 -EDTA for 30 min at 60 °C.
The sliced and smashed samples were imaged with a Leica DM2500 microscope, and cell plan area was measured by Image-Pro Plus.
For transmission electron microscopy, outer pericarp tissues were prefixed in 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at 4 °C.
Tissues were post fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in series acetone, infiltrated in Epox 812 for a longer, and embedded.
The semithin sections were stained with methylene blue and ultrathin sections were cut with diamond knife, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.
Sections were examined with a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM; HITACHI, H-600IV, Japan).
**Anthocyanin, chlorophyll and carotenoid assays.
**
Anthocyanin was assayed according to the procedures described previously [66] .
chlorophyll and green fruits’ total carotenoid was extracted into 80% acetone, and their content was calculated by using Lichtenthaler’s formulas, in which chlorophyll a equals 12.21 _A_ 663 -2.81 _A_ 645, chlorophyll b equals 20.13 _A_ 645 -5.03 _A_ 663, total carotenoids equals (1000 _A_ 470 -3.27 _C_ a-104 _
C_ b)/229.
The red fruits’ carotenoid contents were measured by HPLC as previously described [27], with analytical reagent lycopene and β-carotene as standards.
**Starch Analysis.
** Starch quantification was determined using a starch assay kit (STA20; Sigma-Aldrich) following the manufacturer’s protocol [34] .   SCIEnTIFIC
