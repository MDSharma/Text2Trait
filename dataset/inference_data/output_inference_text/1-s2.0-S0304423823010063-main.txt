Introduction**    A B S T R A C T
In our study, we analyzed three key fruit quality traits in a diverse panel of 265 tomato accessions.
We assessed phenotypic variations and undertook Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) employing eight different sta­ tistical models.
From the 19,843 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained by DArTseq method, 4,253 SNPs were retained for genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
Comparative analysis revealed the superior performance of the FarmCPU and BLINK models in accurately determining SNPs associated with fruit weight, locule number, and citric acid content, effectively reducing both false positives and false negatives.
Other models such as MLM, CMLM, and MLMM struggled to identify relevant SNPs, and GLM was outperformed by BLINK and FarmCPU but was more effective than SUPER and FaST-LMM in reducing spurious SNP associations.
Among the SNPs examined, 20 SNPs were significantly associated to the traits, accounting for 2.32 % to 22.14 % of the phenotypic variance.
BLAST search yielded seven putative candidate genes, four of which were annotated in NCBI’s plant protein reference database.
Additionally, the application of genomic prediction with ridge regression Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (rrBLUP) yielded high accuracy for all three examined traits.
These findings underscore the efficacy of genomic selection in tomato breeding, particularly for traits with high her­ itability, and highlight the critical role of selecting appropriate GWAS models to ensure precise association mapping.
Tomato ( _Solanum lycopersicum_ L.) holds considerable nutritional and economic importance as a crop species within the Solanaceae family, which also includes potato, pepper, and eggplant.
It is cultivated worldwide and ranks among the most widely consumed vegetables.
Economically speaking, in 2020, global tomato production exceeded 187 million tons, grown across 5 million hectares (Branthome, 2022ˆ ).
In Thailand, tomatoes are considered the most important vegetable as their export income amounts to about 1200 million THB.
Due to its economic significance, significant efforts have been invested in enhancing horti­ cultural traits and disease resistance through tomato breeding programs.
Tomato exhibits a wide range of genetic variations in fruit traits, such as shape, size, and weight.
As a result, extensive QTL mapping has been conducted using bi-parental populations to genetically analyze Celik fruit traits, leading to the identification of several major genes (    - Corresponding author.
et al., 2017; Lippman et al., 2001; Munos et al., 2011˜ ; Ranc et al., 2012; Rodriguez et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2013).
However, QTL detection in structured populations derived from two parents has a drawback, as it results in low mapping resolution due to limited recombination events (Holland, 2007; P´erez-de-Castro et al., 2012).
Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a highly effective method for mapping complex traits, enabling the identification of strong link­ ages between markers and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in unstructured populations, such as collections of germplasm and breeding lines.
These GWAS panels exhibit higher recombination rates, leading to improved mapping resolutions compared to bi-parental populations.
Moreover, these populations offer the opportunity to explore diverse alleles asso­ ciated with traits of interest.
Advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology have greatly contributed to GWAS in crop species by enabling the dis­ covery of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

Scientia Horticulturae 327 (2024) 112838_    being the most common type of sequence variation, are well-suited for high-throughput genotyping with automation.
Therefore, the first highthroughput genotyping array was developed.
Furthermore, wholegenome sequencing of diverse tomato accessions across 12 chromo­ somes led to the identification of a large number of SNPs.
For instance, resequencing 96 large-fruit commercial varieties resulted in the detec­ tion of 51,912 SNPs with a mean depth of 1.9x, contributing to the development of the Axiom tomato genotyping array (Yamamoto et al., 2016).
Besides employing NGS-based SNP discovery, researchers have developed several statistical models to enhance the accuracy and effi­ ciency of GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies)
(Segura et al., 2012; Yu and Buckler, 2006; Zhang et al., 2010).
These advancements have facilitated successful GWAS investigations into allele variations concerning fruit quality and morphology in tomatoes.
In one study, using a global collection of 96 accessions representing landraces, vin­ tage, and modern varieties, numerous marker-trait associations were identified for phenolic compounds, ascorbic acid, β-carotene, trans-lycopene, and titratable acidity (Ruggieri et al., 2014).
In another GWAS involving 163 tomato accessions, 44 candidate loci associated with 19 fruit metabolites, including amino acids, sucrose, malate, ascorbate, and citrate, were discovered (Sauvage et al., 2014).
Furthermore, extensive genetic dissection of tomato flavor resulted in the of numerous associations with identification significant flavor-related traits (Tieman et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2019).
For fruit morphological traits, GWAS studies in tomato collec­ tions uncovered several favorable alleles (Lin et al., 2014; Sacco et al., 2015).
A recent investigation examined the genetic variations in 192 tomato accessions from a core collection for six fruit traits and identified a total of 54 loci associated with these traits (Phan et al., 2019).
Moreover, a germplasm collection consisting of a broad-based pop­ ulation (163 accessions) was employed for GWAS to identify genomic regions associated with fruit, flower, and vegetative traits, leading to the discovery of 107 marker-trait associations for eight quantitative traits, including fruit weight and locule number (Mata-Nicol´as et al., 2020).
Additionally, The discovery of SNPs has significantly contributed to the successful implementation of genomic prediction in tomatoes, specif­ ically for assessing fruit quality and morphology (Cappetta et al., 2020; Duangjit et al., 2016; Yamamoto et al., 2016)
In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of GWAS and the preci­ sion of genomic prediction by examining a population consisting of 359 accessions.
Our main goal was to compared eight alternative association mapping statistical models, spanning from single to multi-locus, in order to identify candidate genomic regions associated with fruit quality traits through GWAS.
Then, with the same genotypic and phenotypic data, we applied the GS model called ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction (rrBLUP) combined with cross-validation approach to explore the pre­ dictabilities of genomic selection models in traits of interest.

Methodology**   _2.1.
Genetic materials and DNA extraction_   At the time of this study, the Tropical Vegetable Research Center has collected 531 accessions of tomatoes, 359 of these accessions were selected for genotyping, and their genomic DNA was extracted with a modified CTAB method based on a procedure by Fulton et al. (1995).
For each accession, the DNA was isolated from three-week-old tomatoes.
The isolated DNA samples were quantified with NanoDrop 2000 spec­ trophotometer and diluted to 100 ng/ μ L in TE buffer.
The quality was evaluated by performing agarose gel electrophoresis on undigested DNA samples and those digested with _
EcoR_
I restriction enzyme.    _2.2.
High-throughput genotyping and SNP filtering_
The isolated DNA was sent to DArT Pty Ltd (Canberra, ACT, Australia) and genotyped with the DArTseq analysis.
To produce genomic libraries with reduced complexity, the DNA samples were first digested with _Pst_
I and _Mse_
I restriction enzymes.
The digested DNA fragments were then ligated with restriction site-specific adapters and enriched on Illumina flow cell.
The sequence analysis was performed with Illumnina Hiseq 2000 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
DArT­ soft software was used to align and detect SNPs between the sequencing reads and output the genotypic data as scores.
For this study, SNP markers with missing data _>_ 20 % and minor allele frequency (MAF)  _<_ 0.01 % were removed to filter out low quality and nearly mono­ morphic markers from subsequent analyses.   _2.3.
Phenotyping_   From 359 of these accessions, two hundred and sixty-five tomato accessions from the Tropical Vegetable Research Center grew and were included in this study.
Accessions were planted in a randomized com­ plete block design with six replications at the Faculty of Agriculture at Kamphaeng Saen, Kasetsart University in the summer of 2018 and 2020.
In each tomato plant, at least ten independent fruits were collected and measured for fruit weight, locule number, citric acid.
This is performing to make sure that the total number of phenotypic observations per ge­ notype reflects the complexity of the genetic architecture and the heri­ tability of the trait.
Phenotypic means for each trait in every accession were calculated using the least-squares method.
This was achieved by applying a linear mixed-effects model of the given format.
Y i = _m_ +
genotype i + year i + block(year) jk + e ijk, where Y i is the phenotype for accession i, m is the grand mean, genotype i is the fixed effect (genotypic value) of accession i, year j and block(year)
jk are the random effects of year j and block (nested within year)
k, and e ijk is the error.
It was assumed that random effects were independent and had identical dis­ tributions.
The model was fitted using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) through the R package lme4 (Bates et al., 2014).
_2.4.
GWAS analysis_   GenoGenome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using genomic association and prediction integration tool, GAPIT version 3, (Wang and Zhang, 2021) in R (R Core Team, 2023).
The eight associa­ tion mapping models that were evaluated ranged in complexity from simple to complex and included   (i) general linear model (GLM) with PCA (principle component analysis) (Price et al., 2006) (ii) mixed linear model (MLM) with PCA + _
K_ (Kinship matrix for family relatedness estimates)
(Yu et al., 2006) (iii) compressed MLM (Zhang et al., 2010) (iv) settlement of MLMs under progressively exclusive relationship (SUPER) (Wang et al., 2014b) (v) multi-locus test methods, including multiple loci mixed model (MLMM) (Segura et al., 2012) (vi) factored spectrally transformed linear mixed models (FaST-LMM)
(Lippert et al., 2011) (vii) fixed and random model circulating probability unification (Farm CPU) (Liu et al., 2016) (viii) Bayesian-information and linkage-disequilibrium iteratively nested keyway (BLINK) (Huang et al., 2019)   _2.5.
Model evaluation_   Q-Q plots are commonly used to assess false positives and false negatives in models (Kristensen et al., 2018; Riedelsheimer et al., 2012 Stich and Melchinger, 2009; Würschum et al., 2012).
These plots    2   _N. Prateep-Na-Thalang et al._ _
Scientia Horticulturae 327 (2024) 112838_    compare the expected and observed negative-log association probabili­ ties.
A straight line close to the 1:1 line indicates a uniform distribution, supporting the null hypothesis of no significant association.
Deviations from the straight line indicate the presence of significant associations.
A lack of a straight line and a tail suggests false positives (inflating line) and false negatives (deflating line).
Conversely, a straight line near 1:1 with an upward deviated tail indicates controlled false positives and false negatives, with true associations present.
While most P-values follow a uniform distribution, a few in linkage disequilibrium with a causal polymorphism produce significant values in the “tail” of the plot.   _2.6.
Gene ontology mapping and annotation of identified SNPs_   For the significant SNPs, allele trimmed sequences from DarTSeq were extended 50 bp upstream and downstream using tomato reference genome SL3.0.
The nucleotide sequences are then used as a query, which is first translated in all six reading frames in BlastX using all plant pro­ teins from NCBI as a reference.
Blasted sequences were imported into OmicsBox® (Biobam Bioinformatics S.L.) for gene ontology mapping and gene ontology annotation.
_2.7.
Genomic selection analysis_   Genetic prediction was assessed by comparing GEBV with the actual phenotyping values.
From 265 accessions that phenotype information is available.
Seventy-five percent of the total number of accessions were used to fit the model, in the training validation set.
The remaining ac­ cessions were used as validation set.
In this study, the genotype infor­  = mation from the training set was utilized to fit a model denoted as Y 1µ + Xg + e, where Y represents a vector of observed phenotypic values, µ denotes the overall mean of the training set, fitted as covariates based on the genotype, and e accounts for the residual effect.
Subsequently, the SNP effects were calculated using the mixed-model solver function (mixed.solve).
Using the genotype information and SNP effects, the Genomic Estimated Breeding Values (GEBV) of the validation set were predicted.
To achieve precision, researchers employed the ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction (rrBLUP) statistical model, as introduced by Endelman (2011).
This model, which is akin to the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP), offers rapid processing due to its utilization of a mixed model algorithm with a single variance compo­ nent, apart from the residual error, as described by Kang et al. (2008).
Additionally, this model is conveniently accessible as an R package, accessible at [http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rrBLUP/index.](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rrBLUP/index.html)
[html.
Prediction accuracies were tested by the correlation between](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rrBLUP/index.html) predicted breeding values and evaluated phenotype (true breeding values) for 1000 iterations.

Results**   _3.1.
Phenotypic variations of fruit traits in the tomato collection_
The collection of 265 tomato accessions demonstrated significant phenotypic diversity for three evaluated fruit characteristics, namely, fruit weight, number of locules, and citric acid content, as illustrated in Table 1 and Fig.
1.
The fruit weight exhibited a substantial range, varying from 5.49 g to a maximum of 93.33 g, with an average of 20.89 g across the accessions.
The number of locules per fruit also displayed variability, with a range of 0.31 to 0.87.
As for the citric acid content, it   **Table 1**  Descriptive statistics of tomato phenotypic records.
spanned from 0.25 % to 0.68 %, averaging at 0.42 %.
A PCA plot, derived from genomic relationship matrices, distinguished the cultivars into three distinct clusters as depicted in PCA plots (Figs.
2A, 2C) and scree plot (Fig. 2D).
Collectively, these results demonstrate the consid­ erable diversity encapsulated within this tomato germplasm for traits associated with fruit quality.
Heritability estimates for these traits showed a broad sense heritability of 61 % to 80 %, as detailed in Table 1.   _3.2.
GWAS model comparison of 3 fruit quality traits in tomato_
A total of 19,843 SNPs were initially obtained from the DarTseq analysis.
After filtering with the criteria of PIC ≥ 0.1 and call rate ≥80 %, 4253 SNPs were selected for further genetic diversity and GWAS of three traits in this study.
A comparison made between eight distinct association mapping models, varying in complexity from simple to complex.
These models identified varying numbers of significant SNP markers at the same significance threshold (Fig. 3).
We set the signifi­ cance threshold at − Log10 (P) _>_ 4.93, applying a Bonferroni adjust­ ment, to gain significant association SNPs.
For fruit weight, we identified 10 SNPs from GLM, 73 SNPs from SUPER, 73 SNPs from FaSTLMM, 3 SNPs from FarmCPU, and 3 SNPs from BLINK; and no associa­ tion was identified by MLM, CMLM, and MLMM models (Table 2).
In terms of locule number, GLM detected the largest number of SNPs, totaling 31.
SUPER and FaST-LMM, on the other hand, identified 18 SNPs each.
FarmCPU and BLINK, in contrast, revealed 6 and 7 associated SNPs, respectively.
Notably, five of these SNPs were detected by both Tables 2 FarmCPU and BLINK, indicating an overlap in their findings ( and 3).
In total, the eight models jointly detected 43 SNPs associated with citric acid content in tomatoes.
Specifically, GLM pinpointed 5 SNPs, while both SUPER and FaST-LMM independently revealed 30 SNPs each.
FarmCPU and BLINK identified four SNPs each, with SNP_06051 on chromosome 3 being a notable standout, as it was identified by four of the models (GLM, SUPER, FarmCPU, and BLINK).
We observed both SUPER and FaST-LMM identified multiple signif­ icant SNP marker associations in close physical proximity on the chro­ mosome.
These substantial peaks resulted from one SNP within each peak having the highest significant association with the traits, while the other markers in the same peak were in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) with this most significant marker.
_3.3.
Identified SNPs associated with fruit quality traits in tomato_   For the fruit weight and locule number, SUPER and FasT-LMM models had a large number of false positives as indicated by substan­ tial inflation of p-values (Fig. 3).
Q-Q plots of MLM, CMLM, MLMM models had a straight line with a slightly deviated tail, but associated SNPs were not identified.
In contrast, the FarmCPU and BLINK models followed a straight line close to 1:1, with a sharp upward deviated tail (Fig.
3A, B).
For the percentage of citric acid, the FarmCPU showed a uniform distribution close to the 1:1 line.
However, slightly inflated straight line was observed with upward deviated tail in BLINK model (Fig.
3C).
It is noteworthy that despite the numerous significant SNPs identi­ fied by the eight GWAS models, only those with at least moderate deflation or inflation of Q-Q plots were considered as genuine associated SNPs, as presented in Table 3.

Notably, chromosome 7 har­ bors the most significant SNPs for tomato fruit weight, as indicated in Fig.

While MLMM analysis’s Q-Q plot suggests a generally expected distribution of P-values, there is a slight deviation at the tail end within    the 95 % confidence band.
No genome-wide significant SNPs for fruit weight were detected (Figs. 3 and 4); however, FarmCPU and BLINK pinpointed a highly significant marker at the same locus on chromosome 7 (SNP_11,268), with attributing 22.14 % (BLINK) and 21.72 %    4   _N. Prateep-Na-Thalang et al._ _

Associated markers at chromosomes 3, 4, and 5 were identified in either BLINK model (explaining 3.05 %–8.37 %) or Farm­  – CPU model (explaining 5.93 % 7.19 %) of the phenotypic variation (Table 3 and Fig. 4).
For locule number, FarmCPU and BLINK identified 6 and 7 signifi­ cant SNPs, respectively, with five concordant markers across chromo­ somes 1, 2, 3, 7, and 12 (Fig. 5, Table 3).
The most significant SNPs, based on BLINK and FarmCPU models, were located on chromosomes 7 (SNP_10,605) and 12 (SNP_17,733).
According to BLINK, they account   **Table 3** Genome-wide significant markers.    for 8.85 % and 8.56 % of the variance, with allelic effects of − 0.0373 and − 0.063, respectively.
The remaining overlapping SNP markers for  – locule number collectively explain 3.31 % 6.15 % of the phenotypic  variation.
In the context of citric acid content, 43 SNPs demonstrated signifi­ cance, although only a subset of them is considered robust.
The MLMM and FaST-LMM models exhibited the most consistent Q-Q plot unifor­ mity compared to the previous traits (Fig. 6).
Notably, FaST-LMM did not identify any SNPs, while one of MLMM’s SNPs approached signifi­ cance with -Log10(P)
= 4.91, slightly beneath the cutoff threshold of _>_  4.93.
One noteworthy SNP, SNP_06051 on chromosome 3, stood out in these models.
Although it did not reach significance in other models, it consistently appeared across FarmCPU, and BLINK models, surpassing the significance threshold (Table 3).
This particular SNP accounts for 5.82 % of the phenotypic variance, with an allelic effect of 0.026 (Fig. 6).
Additionally, the most significant marker associated with citric acid content was identified by BLINK as SNP_01844 on chromosome 1, attributing 20.88 % of the phenotypic variance, with an allelic effect of  − 0.052.   _3.4.

7 SNPs associated with candidate genes.
Subsequently, we utilized OmicsBox® to map and was able to annotate 4 SNPs from 2 phenotypes (SNP_03723 on chromosome 2 and SNP_01821 on chromosome 1 for locule number; SNP_13,946 on chromosome 9 and SNP_16,862 on chromosome 11 for citric acid content).
The GO annotations provided offer insight into the biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components associated with the SNPs (Table 4).
SNP_01844, which exhibited one of the highest percentages of phenotypic variance explained (% PVE) in citric acid levels, was sub­ jected to a BLASTx search.
The analysis revealed that this SNP is situated within the coding region of a putative agamous-like MADS-box protein, specifically an AGL21-like isoform X1.
However, no additional annota­ tions were found upon further annotation with NCBI’s plant protein reference database.

Genomic prediction using rrBLUP_   When predicting trait outcomes using a training set comprising 75 % of the population (199 accessions) with 4253 markers, we observed variability in accuracy among different traits (as detailed in Table 5, which presents the average, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum correlation values between observed phenotypes and pre­ dictions).
Fruit weight predictions were the most accurate, with a maximum accuracy value of 0.851 (0.851± 0.040), while citric acid content predictions were less accurate, with a minimum accuracy value of 0.633± 0.081).
The heritability for these traits was recorded at 0.614 for fruit weight and 0.612 for citric acid content, respectively.
**4.
Dıscussıon**   Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have markedly enhanced the analysis of tomato fruit quality traits.
The selected statistical model heavily dictates the results.
For instance, deviations in P-value distri­ bution seen in FaST-LMM and SUPER, as evidenced in Q-Q plots (Fig. 3), corroborate with earlier findings (Kaler et al., 2020), indicating these models are inappropriate for association mapping for the studied traits because they generate spurious marker-trait associations, potentially due to suboptimal correction for complex population structure or stratification (Liu et al., 2016).
False associations may also arise from varying degrees in kinship between individual pairs.
This confounding effect can be attenuated by implementing a general linear model (GLM) that quantifies the pro­ portion of genes that are identical by descent for each pair of individuals.
Selective exclusion of individuals who exhibit close genetic relatedness can further refine the model, thereby reducing the potential for bias in association estimates (Voight et al., 2005; Li et al., 2014).
This is why we observed a presence of moderate rates of spurious associations (Table 2).
In the Q-Q plots for the MLM and CMLM, a pattern was noted that largely followed the expected diagonal but with tails that diverged slightly.
This pattern suggests a decrease in false positives with an accompanying increase in false negatives, given that the majority of significant markers clustered near the expected trendline.
Such an in­ crease in false negatives could be due to overfitting, wherein the vari­ ance attributed to random effects is overestimated, thereby obscuring true genetic associations (Kaler et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2010).
Li Consistent findings have been reported across various investigations ( et al., 2018; Tamba et al., 2017; Wen et al., 2015; 2018), indicating a tendency for more sophisticated models to yield an increased incidence of false negatives.
In contrast, the Q-Q plots of the FarmCPU and BLINK, advanced multi-locus GWAS models, demonstrated regulation of both false posi­ tives and negatives, as shown by the plots that largely adhered to the expected diagonal with prominent deviations at the tails, with the exception noted for BLINK in citric acid dataset (Fig. 3).
However, when it came to determining statistical significance in association mapping, FarmCPU took a notably conservative approach, resulting in lower -log10(P-values) compared to those obtained with BLINK (see Figs. 4–6).
Moreover, FarmCPU exhibited the capability to identify specific markers ’s conservative that eluded detection by BLINK, reflecting both FarmCPU nature and its precision in marker identification.
Simultaneously, BLINK was able to uncover certain associated SNPs that were not detected by   **Table 5**  Result from genomic selection using rrBLUP.
Fruit weight Locule number Citric acid   Mean 0.851 0.643 0.633  SD 0.040 0.068 0.081  Median 0.858 0.646 0.640  Min 0.672 0.428 0.303  Max 0.941 0.826 0.818    other methods.
These outcomes are consistent with the observations  made in the study by Gai et al. (2023) and imply that disparities in statistical power between these models may underlie this variability.
Wang and Zhang (2021) indicate that multi-locus models such as FarmCPU and BLINK outperform less complex models, and BLINK sur­ passes FarmCPU.
FarmCPU, in particular, reduces the risk of overfitting by implementing dual adjustments when assessing markers, according to Liu et al. (2016).
Initially, it accounts for population structure, family relatedness, and pseudo-quantitative trait nucleotides.
subsequently, it refines the derivation of family relatedness across all markers or selec­ tively factors in or out pseudo-quantitative trait nucleotides, depending on their association with the markers being tested (Liu et al., 2016).
BLINK has advanced beyond FarmCPU by discarding the premise that quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs), must be uniformly spread across the genome, opting instead to employ information on linkage disequi­ librium.
This advancement allows BLINK to use a more streamlined  Fixed Effect Model (FEM) rather than the more resource-intensive Random Effect Model (REM), significantly cutting down on analysis  ’ time.
Studies have confirmed BLINK s enhanced efficiency in analyzing vast datasets and its ability to bolster statistical power over FarmCPU (Cebeci et al., 2023; Gai et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2019).
Further research validates BLINK’s effectiveness, particularly its Bayesian framework, assumes that causal genes are distributed variably, thus reducing the rate of false positives—an essential consideration for complex genetic patterns (Kim et al., 2021).
Out of the 20 associated SNPs, BlastX analysis successfully identified 7 SNPs associated with candidate genes.
Subsequently, we utilized OmicsBox® to map and annotate these seven SNPs.
It’s noteworthy that the remaining SNPs lacked annotation in the reference database, possibly due to their lower sequence similarity, which was below the annotation cut-off threshold set at 55.
Additionally, shorter sequences may inherently have limited information available for functional annotation, especially if they do not encompass critical functional do­ mains or regions.
Among the annotated SNPs, the discovery of an SNP_01844 within a MADS-box gene holds exciting implications for controlling citric acid content in tomato fruit.
MADS-box proteins play crucial roles in plant development, including fruit ripening and floral organ formation.
Highlighted MADS-box proteins influence on ethylene production, a key ripening hormone that impacts organic acid metabolism (Garceau et al., 2017; Quinet et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2014a).
The AGL21-like isoform X1, associated with this SNP, may affect citric acid regulation.
This SNP could be a target for improving tomato taste profiles, though more ev­ idence is needed to confirm causality.
In the practice of genomic selection (GS), breeders target a variety of traits without being constrained by their inheritability or genetic structure.
These traits often exhibit commendable heritability, trans­ lating into predictable outcomes through GS, as supported by numerous studies (Duangjit et al., 2016; Hayes et al., 2009; Lorenz et al., 2012; Wimmer et al., 2013).
High heritability traits are often dictated by a strong genetic influence, making them more amenable to GS predictions (Resende et al., 2012).
However, the trait of locule number presents an anomaly with its high heritability (0.795) not correlating with the ex­ pected accuracy (0.643), which contrasts with traits like fruit weight that, despite lower heritability, predict more accurately.
This pattern is supported by findings from Pascual et al. (2016) and Duangjit et al. (2016).
Incorporating quantitative trait loci (QTL) information as part of the GS model for such traits is crucial.
Generally, including the effects of QTLs that fall below the usual threshold in GS has been demonstrated to enhance selection efficacy for traits with low heritability (Calus et al., 2008).
The rrBLUP method, in particular, has been lauded for its efficacy (Resende et al., 2012).
Incorporating Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) identified in GWAS as fixed effects enhances the precision of genomic predictions (Spindel et al., 2016), a methodology that could be partic­ ularly advantageous for improving complex traits like fruit yield and    8   _N. Prateep-Na-Thalang et al._ _

Such advancements in GWAS have the potential to significantly refine trait predictions, offering a promising avenue for tomato breeding programs.

Conclusions**   This study emphasizes the importance of selecting an appropriate Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) model for plant breeding, with a focus on tomato crops where quality trait breeding is complex due to multiple genetic factors.
The study tested various models and identified BLINK as the most suitable for its robustness in controlling false positives and negatives, particularly for traits like fruit weight, locule number, and citric acid content in tomato puree.
Additionally, the study reported high accuracy in Genomic Selection (GS) using rrBLUP models for these traits in a germplasm population at Kasetsart University, indicating that precise selection of statistical tools is vital for identifying favorable al­ leles and developing effective breeding strategies to enhance crop quality traits.
