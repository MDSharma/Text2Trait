In** **this study, we fine-mapped the locus from a 47 Mb to a 3.03 Mb interval on the long arm of chromosome 8.
Of the 122 anno-** **tated genes found in the** _**fs8.1**_ **region, 51 were expressed during floral development and six were differentially expressed in** **anthesis-stage ovaries in** _**fs8.1**_ **and wild-type (WT) lines.

**Introduction**    Fruit shape is an important horticultural trait for fruit and vegetable crops.
In tomato, fruit shape determines the main use of a particular variety: elongated and blocky fruit are    preferred for mechanically harvested processing tomatoes, while fasciated fruit with many locules is ideal for the fresh market and is used for slicing (van der Knaap and Tanksley,    Abbreviations: LC-MS/MS, pressure liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; NIL, near-isogenic line; PE, paired end; PPR, pentatricopeptide repeat protein; QTL, quantitative trait locus; RNA-Seq, RNA sequencing; RPKM, reads per kb of exon model per million mapped reads; SGN, Sol Genomics Network; SNP, single-nucleotide polymorphism.

In addition, fruit shape variation provides a good entry point to investigate the domestication and selection history of tomato, as well as providing fundamental insights into the regulation of plant organ shape (van der Knaap _et al._, 2014).
Based on previous studies, there are two categories of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that control tomato fruit shape: _
lc_ ( _locule number_ ) and _fas_ ( _fasciated_ ) controlling locule number and flat shape, and _sun_, _ovate_, and _fs8.1_ controlling elongated shape (Grandillo _et al._, 1996; Gonzalo and van der Knaap, 2008; Rodríguez _et al._, 2011; van der Knaap _et al._, 2014).
Genes underlying tomato fruit shape QTLs were cloned via fine-mapping: _
LC_ probably encodes an orthologue of WUSCHEL, a homeodomain transcription factor that is required for maintaining the stem-cell identity in the shoot apical meristem (Mayer _et al._, 1998; Clark, 2001; Muños _et al._, 2011); _FAS_ encodes CLV3, a small secreted protein that acts in the WUS–CLV3 signalling pathway (Schoof _et al._, 2000; Xu _et al._, 2015); and _SUN_ encodes a member of the IQD family of calmodulinbinding proteins (Xiao _et al._, 2008).
One member of this family, AtIQD1, interacts with both kinesin light-chain-related protein-1 (KLCR1) and calmodulin/calmodulin-like proteins (CaM/CMLs), recruiting them to microtubules (Abel _et al._, 2005;
Bürstenbinder _et al._, 2013); _OVATE_ is the founding member of the OVATE family proteins (OFPs) and its members are often characterized as transcriptional repressors (Liu _et al._, 2002; Hackbusch _et al._, 2005; Wang _et al._, 2007, 2011).
However, the gene(s) underlying _fs8.1_ has not been identified because reduced recombination rates around the locus prevented the fine-mapping to a short region.
This has left a gap in our further understanding of the molecular basis of genes controlling of fruit shape and their putative interactions with each other.
The first report of the _fs8.1_ map position was in a BC 1 population derived from a cross between _Solanum lycoper-_ _sicum_ cv. M82, bearing rectangular elongated fruit, and the closely related wild species _Solanum pimpinellifolium_ accession no. LA1589, bearing small round fruit (Grandillo and Tanksley, 1996).
The locus _fs8.1_ explained up to 27.4% of the fruit shape index (the ratio of height and width) and was further mapped to a 22.8 cM interval on chromosome 8 flanked by markers TG176 and CT92 (Grandillo _et al._, 1996).
With the identification of new recombinants, _fs8.1_ was narrowed to a 3.2 cM region flanked by markers CD40 and CT92 (Ku _et al._, 2000).
Single-point analysis conducted in both BC 1 and BC 2 populations indicated that CD40 is most closely associated with _fs8.1_ (Grandillo _et al._, 1996), and further studies showed that the locus segregated with a cluster of markers near TG45 (Ku _et al._, 2000).
Unfortunately, the tomato reference genome sequence (The Tomato Genome Consortium, 2012) showed that the 3.2 cM interval was a large region of approximately 47 Mb containing ~700 annotated genes.
This number far exceeded the chance of identifying the correct candidate gene based on predicted function.
In addition to elongated shape, _fs8.1_ controls bumpy fruit shape and fruit size in a population derived from a cross with Yellow Stuffer, a tomato variety that features hollow and bumpy fruit similar in morphology to bell peppers ( _Capsicum annuum_ )
(van der    Knaap and Tanksley, 2003).
These findings suggest that _
fs8.1_ has pleiotropic effects in controlling distinct aspects of fruit development in different genetic backgrounds.
Therefore, _fs8.1_ may be useful for breeders to create varieties with a bell and blocky shape as well as elongated fruit shape.
In this study, we sought to identify candidate genes of _FS8.1_ .
We conducted additional fine-mapping, evaluated the expression of candidate genes, and searched for potential nucleotide polymorphisms that could underlie the mutation leading to fruit elongation.
Furthermore, detailed phenotypic evaluations showed that the main effect of _fs8.1_ was to uniformly increase cell number in reproductive organs in the proximal–distal direction.
This process might be controlled by auxin as its intermediates slightly differentially accumulated in _fs8.1_ and WT ovaries.
When considering phenotypic, DNA sequence, and expression data as well as the putative function of the genes in the region, several were identified as likely candidates to regulate fruit shape.
**Material and methods**   _Plant material, fine-mapping, progeny testing, and near-isogenic_
_line (NIL) development_
Two F 3 plants (08S33-10 and 08S34-10) derived from a cross between _S. lycopersicum_ cv.
Rio Grande and a wild species, _S. pimpinellifolium_ accession no.
LA1589, were backcrossed to Rio Grande four times [by marker-assisted selection (Supplementary Fig.
S1 and Table S1,](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) available at _JXB_ online).
During the selection, the _fs8.1_ locus was maintained in the heterozygous state, while other chromosomes and regions outside the _fs8.1_ interval were genotyped to select seedlings that were mostly homozygous for Rio Grande alleles.
During the backcross process, recombinant plants were selected for progeny testing to narrow down the _fs8.1_ region.
Seedlings obtained from these selfed recombinant plants were selected to result in at least five homozygous mutants, five homozygous WT, and two heterozygous at _fs8.1_, and fruit shape was evaluated.
The three independent backcrossed and selfed lines used for RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) were 09S204 (BC 4 F 2 ), 09S236 (BC 3 F 2 ), and 09S237 (BC 1 F 4 [), (Supplementary](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1)
[Fig.
S1 and Table S2, available at](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) _JXB_ online).
The three families used for mapping the _fs8.1_ region to 3.03 Mb were 11S51 (BC 4 F 2 ), 11S65 (BC 4 F 2 ), and 11S156 (BC 4 F 3 [) (Supplementary Fig.
S1).
To](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) test whether _fs8.1_ segregated in Yellow Pear, an F 2 population generated from a cross between this variety and LA1589 was evaluated for association of the locus with fruit shape in lines selected to be fixed for _ovate_ .
Morphological, histological, and auxin metabolism analyses were performed in the BC 4 F 4, BC 4 F 5, and BC 4 F 6 families (13S117, 13S118, 13S161, 13S140, 14S38, 14S92, 14S114, and [14S169), which were considered NILs (Supplementary Fig.
S1).
The](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) plants used in this study were grown in the field or greenhouse at the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center (OARDC, Wooster, OH, USA).
To avoid outcrossing, all backcrosses, selfs and recombinant plant seed increases were performed in the greenhouse.
_Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small indel_ _
analysis and marker development_ SNPs between _S. lycopersicum_ and _S. pimpinellifolium_ were identified by comparing their genome contig assemblies at the Sol Genomics [Network (SGN, http://solgenomics.net/).
Derived cleaved amplified](http://solgenomics.net/) polymorphic sequences (dCAPS) markers were then designed using [dCAPS Finder 2.0 (http://helix.wustl.edu/dcaps/dcaps.html) under](http://helix.wustl.edu/dcaps/dcaps.html)
the option of allowing only one mismatch in the primer.
Sequences flanking the high-likelihood indels of 12 bp or more were used to design primers using Primer3 (Rozen and Skaletsky, 1999).
For investigating the genomic variation of the 3.03 Mb region spanning the _fs8.1_ locus between tomato cultivars carrying _fs8.1_ and the WT allele, alignments were performed using genome sequences of M82 and Yellow Pear, respectively.
The genome sequencing reads of M82 and Yellow Pear were reported by (Bolger _et al._, 2014 _a_ ) and (Strickler _et al._, 2014), respectively, and were obtained from SGN FTP site (ftp://ftp.solgenomics.net/genomes/Solanum_lycopersi[cum/yellow_pear/) and NCBI sequence read archive (http://www.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=ERA310345)
[ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=ERA310345](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=ERA310345)
[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=ERA310345)
[gov/sra/?term=ERA310345), respectively.
The paired-end (PE) reads](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=ERA310345) of both M82 and Yellow Pear were processed using Trimmomatic (Bolger _et al._, 2014 _b_ ) to remove adaptor and low-quality sequences.
Reads shorter than 40 bp were discarded.
The resulting reads were aligned to the ‘Heinz 1706’ tomato reference genome using BWA (version 0.6.2)
(Li and Durbin, 2010).
Only one of the duplicated PE reads was kept to minimize the artefacts of PCR amplification, and only reads uniquely mapped (having one single best hit) to the genome were used.
Following alignments, SNPs and small indels between Yellow Pear and M82 were identified based on the mpileup files generated by SAMtools (Li _et al._, 2009).
The identified SNPs and small indels were supported by at least two distinct reads.
_
RNA-Seq library construction and sequencing_  Three partial backcrossed lines were used to analyse gene expression and to identify putative candidate gene(s) underlying _fs8.1_
[(Supplementary Fig.
S1 and Table S2).
For each backcrossed line](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) pair, 20 ovaries at the anthesis stage were dissected from five plants each carrying _fs8.1_ or the WT allele, respectively, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen, USA) as described by the manufacturer.
RNA quantity and quality were assessed using an Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer using an Agilent DNA 1000 chip kit.
Sequencing was carried out using the Illumina GAII platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) at the Molecular and Cellular Imaging Center, Wooster, OH, USA.
Prior to the library preparation, ~5 μg of total RNA for each samples was treated with RNAase-free DNAase (Invitrogen) to remove the remaining DNA.
PE libraries were prepared using an Illumina PE library preparation kit (Illumina) according to manufacturer’s instruction.
To select the appropriate size and to remove free adapters, the products were gel isolated on a 2% TAE/agarose gel (Certified Low-Range Ultra Agarose; Biorad).
Prior to sequencing, 15 rounds of PCR were performed using the Illumina PE 1.0 and PE 2.0 primers.
The library insert sizes were validated using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and quantified using quantitative PCR with a PhiX sequencing control as a standard (Illumina).
_
RNA-Seq expression analysis_  Filtration, alignment, and calculation of the Illumina reads were carried out according to Huang _et al._ (2013).
The final expression data were shown as reads per kb of exon model per million mapped reads (RPKM).
Because the six samples came from three independent backcrossed lines, statistical analysis using DESeq could not be performed, and averaging the expression data was also not possible.
Thus, we treated the three sets of RNA-Seq data as real-time PCR experiments and analysed the results separately.
For further analyses, the RNA-Seq data were filtered using three thresholds: (i) the RPKM value must be >2 in at least two of the three comparisons; (ii) the log2-fold change value ( _fs8.1_ /WT) must be in the same direction for each comparison; and (iii) as the 09S204 family had the smallest introgression region of the three backcrossed [lines (Supplementary Table S3, available at](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) _
JXB_ online), the absolute value of log 2 fold change must be >0.5 in the 09S204 family as well as in one of the other two families.
To identify the pathway that might be impacted by _fs8.1_, the filtered log2-fold change data were [imported into Mapman (http://mapman.gabipd.org/web/guest/map-](http://mapman.gabipd.org/web/guest/mapman)
[man) and analysed by aligning against the ITAG2.3 gene annotation](http://mapman.gabipd.org/web/guest/mapman)

To identify the candidate gene(s) underlying _fs8.1_, expression of the genes in the 3.03 Mb introgression region was investigated in several RNA-Seq datasets including ovaries at anthesis (this study), vegetative and floral meristems in _S. lycopersicum_ cv.
M82
(Park _et al._, 2012), and vegetative meristem, young flower bud, and anthesis flowers in _S_ .

1A, B).
The images were opened in Tomato Analyzer version 3.0 (Rodríguez _et al._, 2010) and morphology parameters were analysed according to the user manual [(http://oardc.osu.edu/vanderknaap/tomato_analyzer.php).](http://oardc.osu.edu/vanderknaap/tomato_analyzer.php) Floral organs were collected from the 13S117, 13S118, and 13S140 families at anthesis and flattened on 1.5% (w/v) agarose before being scanned [(Fig. 1D).
Floral organ shapes were evaluated using ImageJ (http://](http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/)
[rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/).](http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/)   _Fruit and seed weight, and fruit structure analyses_ Fruit and seed weight was evaluated in fruits collected from the greenhouse (13S117 [and 13S118) and from field-grown plants (14S92) (Supplementary](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1)
[Fig. S1).
Transversely cut and scanned fruit were evaluated for fruit](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) structure, including overall area, and pericarp, placenta, and septum areas using Tomato Analyzer version 3.0 (Fig. 1C).
_
Histological analysis of ovaries at anthesis and mature fruits_
Ultrathin resin-embedded sections of ovary at anthesis and free-hand sectioning of the fresh pericarp were performed in both proximal–distal and mediolateral directions (Fig.
1E–H) (see [Supplementary Materials](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1)
[and methods, available at](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) _JXB_ online).
Ovary sections were collected according to the method of Xiao _et al._ (2009) and imaged using a Leica DM IRB microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany) coupled to a CCD camera under a ×10 objective lens.
The entire ovary was reconstructed using overlapping images and merged with Photoshop CS5 (Adobe, USA), ‘Photomerge’ function, under the option of ‘Reposition’.
For mature fruit, free-hand sections were stained with 0.5% toluidine blue in 0.1% sodium carbonate solution (SPI, Electron Microscopy Supplies) and images were taken with a Leica MZFLIII microscope coupled to a digital camera (SPOT RT KE; Diagnostic Instruments).
Estimations of cell number and size were performed using ImageJ software.
_Vegetative organ and flowering time_
Flowering time (defined as leaf number below the second inflorescence), total leaf number (>1 cm), leaf length, leaflet number, total internode length, stem thickness, and total side shoot length were determined when the first flower of the second inflorescence had opened.
Leaf parameters were measured on the sixth, seventh, and eight leaf.
Total internode length and stem thickness were measured from the sixth to the tenth internode.
Total side shoot length was investigated for the side shoots that were in the first to fifth leaf axils.
Terminal leaflet length, width, and shape index were investigated in the seventh to tenth leaf.
Because of the curved shape of the leaflets, they were cut and scanned in pieces, and analysed with ImageJ software.
Leaflet shape index was defined as maximal length divided by maximal width.
_
Auxin, tryptophan, and tryptamine quantification_  Anthesis-stage ovaries of the _fs8.1_ NILs (14S38 and 14S114) were collected at 10 a.m. and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Approximately 15–20 mg of tissue was weighed and ground in liquid nitrogen and final sample mass was recorded.
Samples were extracted with sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, as described by Novák _et al._ (2012), with the following modifications: samples were extracted at 4 °C, and either 25 ng of indole-3-propionic acid (Santa   **6474 |** Sun _et al._   **Fig. 1.** Morphological and histological analyses of reproductive organs in _fs8.1_ NILs.

**Results**   _Fine-mapping of_ fs8.1 _to a 3.03 Mb region_
Using the cultivated tomato and LA1589 genome sequences for additional marker development, we identified three recombinant plants in the _fs8.1_ region.
Detailed investigations showed that plant 11S51-18, selfed progeny of plant 10S168#2–51, carried recombination breakpoints between markers 11EP239 at 48.9 and 12EP21 at 49.1 Mb on one  side and between markers 11EP245 at 51.8 and 11EP249 at 51.9 Mb on the other side (Fig. 2).
Progeny testing of this line showed a significant association of fruit shape with the allele at the locus ( _P_ <0.001).
Thus, we concluded that _
fs8.1_ was in the region between markers 11EP239 and 11EP249 with a physical distance of approximately 3.03 Mb (Fig. 2).
Based on    the reference genome and chromosome structure, this region was located on a single scaffold (SGN: SL2.40sc04948) that [contained 52 gaps of 100 bp or larger (Supplementary Table](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1)
[S4, available at](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) _JXB_ online) and might harbour the border of heterochromatin to euchromatin (Shearer _et al._, 2014).
_
Expression analysis of annotated genes in the 3.03 Mb_ _introgression_   The gene(s) underlying _fs8.1_ may be differentially expressed, thereby causing the fruit shape phenotype.
Furthermore, not all annotated genes in this region may be expressed.
Therefore, we sought to evaluate gene expression of those that were located in the 3.03 Mb region in three RNA-Seq datasets including our own.
Of the 122 annotated genes in the introgression region, 51 were expressed at more than 2 RPKM in at least one of the three different datasets (Fig.
3 and [Supplementary Table S5, available at](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) _

Among the expressed genes, 29 were expressed in all three datasets.
Eight genes ( _Solyc08g062250_, _Solyc08g062280_, _Solyc08g062310_, _Solyc08g062330_, _Solyc08g062360_, _Solyc08g062220_, _Solyc08g062490_, and _Solyc08g062290_ ) were only found in the dataset representing tissues from the wild relative, LA1589 (Huang _et al._, 2013); three genes ( _Solyc08g061570_, _Solyc08g06158_, and _Solyc08g062780_ ) were only found in the dataset representing cultivated tomato M82 meristems (Park _et al._, 2012); and three genes ( _Solyc08g061880_, _Solyc08g061950_, and _Solyc08g062690_ ) were   Candidate gene selection and function of _fs8.1_

Four expressed genes](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) ( _Solyc08g062340_, _Solyc08g062450_, _Solyc08g062370_, and _Solyc08g062580_ ) were consistently downregulated (log2-fold change <–0.5) in anthesis-stage ovaries carrying _fs8.1_, whereas two genes ( _Solyc08g061650_ and _Solyc08g061950_ ) were upregulated (log 2 [-fold change >0.5) (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1)
[S5).
These genes encoded members of the class II small heat-](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) shock protein, a senescence-related protein, and a pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein, respectively.
In addition to differentially expressed genes, several of the non-differentially expressed genes were related to auxin homeostasis ( _Solyc08g061820_ ), polar auxin transport ( _Solyc08g062630_ ), cytokinin degradation ( _Solyc08g061930_ ), and an ERECTA-like receptor kinase involved in organ shape regulation ( _Solyc08g061560_ )
(Fig. 3, [Supplementary Table S5).](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1)   _Genetic variations between cultivars carrying_ fs8.1 _or_ _the WT allele_
To evaluate whether other cultivars carry _fs8.1_, an F 2 population was generated from a cross between Yellow Pear and LA1589, the latter carrying the WT allele at the locus.
As no association of fruit shape with the alleles of _fs8.1_ was observed in a popu[lation derived from these two parents (Supplementary Table](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1)
[S6, available at](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) _JXB_ online), we concluded that the tomato cultivar Yellow Pear carried the WT allele of the _fs8.1_ locus.
Previously, M82 has been shown to carry the mutant allele of _fs8.1_ (Grandillo _et al._, 1996; Grandillo and Tanksley, 1996; Ku _et al._, 2000) and therefore M82 and Yellow Pear should differ    in the causative nucleotide sequence polymorphism underlying the locus.
By aligning the DNA sequences of these two accessions, 158 SNPs and five small indels were identified in the 3.03 Mb region spanning the _fs8.1_
[locus (Supplementary Table](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1)
[S4).
Of these, 19 SNPs were located within 10 kb upstream](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) of the transcription start point of 14 expressed genes, five SNPs and one small indel were located in 10 kb downstream  of four expressed genes, and lastly, three SNPs were located in introns of three expressed genes and three other SNPs were located in the exons of three expressed genes ( _Solyc08g061850_, _Solyc08g061910_, and _Solyc08g062200_
[) (Fig. 4, Supplementary](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1)
[Table S4).
The three exonic SNPs resulted in a non-synony-](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) mous change (N253D), a premature stop codon, and addition [of 190 aa, respectively (Fig. 4, Supplementary Table S4).
The](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) mutation in _Solyc08g061910_ leading to the premature stop codon probably resulted in a null mutation.
The high level of genome sequence read depth of 50- to 52-fold and the inclusion [of two M82 and Yellow Pear SNP datasets (http://solgenomics.](http://solgenomics.net/jbrowse/JBrowse-1.11.4/?data=data/json/tomato_variants;)
[net/jbrowse/JBrowse-1.11.4/?data=data/json/tomato_variants;](http://solgenomics.net/jbrowse/JBrowse-1.11.4/?data=data/json/tomato_variants;)
Lin _et al._, 2014; E. van der Knaap, unpublished) suggested that these polymorphisms were most likely correct.
However, despite the knowledge that structural variation often underlies phenotypic diversity (van der Knaap et al, 2014), large indels, inversions, translocations, and copy number variants were not analysed due to the characteristics of the sequence data.
_Expression level differences suggest that several_ _
developmental processes are impacted by_ fs8.1
To determine the effect of the _fs8.1_ alleles on gene expression elsewhere in the genome and potential downstream targets, the   **6476 |** Sun _et al._   **Fig.

In the column ‘Gene ID’, red colour, bold, underline, and regular font, respectively, indicate genes only expressed in VM and AO, differentially expressed genes in AOs of _fs8.1_ backcrossed lines, genes harbouring mutations in their putative amino acid sequences, and candidate genes that were selected based on their putative functions.
The RNA-Seq datasets of M82 and LA1589 are from Park _et al._ (2012) and Huang _et al._ (2013), respectively.
RNA-Seq data collected from the three different partially backcrossed lines were used to calculate the log 2 -fold change for each expressed gene in each of the lines.
After filtering, 607 genes were obtained for enrichment analysis.
Using the hypergeometric tests, enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms for differentially expressed genes were found in the pathways of the cell cycle, cell wall, photosynthesis, and the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis [(Supplementary Table S7, available at](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) _
JXB_ online).
Among these, genes involved in the cell cycle and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (cyclin B and D family proteins, hydroxycinnamoyl CoA quinate transferase,and HXXXD-type acyl-transferase) were downregulated in _fs8.1_ compared with WT, whereas genes encoding xyloglucan endotransglycosylase-related proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis were consistently upregulated in _fs8.1_
[(Supplementary Table S7).
These findings suggested a role for](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) these genes in regulating fruit elongation mediated by _fs8.1_ .
_
The effect of_ fs8.1
_is to elongate reproductive organs_
We wanted to know whether _fs8.1_ controls the shape of other plant organs in addition to the fruit.
The maximal length and shape index were significantly increased in all reproductive organs except for the style, while the maximal width did    not differ (Table 1).
To evaluate the effect of _fs8.1_ on development, shape index changes were monitored during fruit growth.
The dynamics of the shape index of _fs8.1_ and WT followed the same pattern during fruit development, with the highest value occurring at 5 d post anthesis (Fig. 5).
However, the final fruit shape index of both _fs8.1_ and WT was similar to the shape index of anthesis-stage ovaries (Fig. 5).
In addition to the shape index, _fs8.1_ also significantly increased fruit weight and pericarp area.
Other traits related to fruit structure and seed weight were not consistently different between _fs8.1_
[and WT (Supplementary Table S8, available at](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) _JXB_ online).
For the vegetative traits, only total side shoot length was consistently increased in _fs8.1_ and at two different time
[points (Supplementary Table S9, available at](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) _JXB_ online).
fs8.1 _leads to an elongated ovary and fruit by_ _increased cell number in the proximal–distal direction_
Changes in organ shape are often accomplished by altered cell division or cell size patterns.
To gain further insights into the mechanism by which _fs8.1_ leads to elongated ovaries and fruits, we evaluated the cellular parameters at the tissue level (Fig.
1E–H).

number was significantly increased in the proximal–distal direction in the ovary wall and fruit pericarp, and in the ovary columella (Table 2).
In contrast, cell number in the mediolateral direction was not consistently different between _fs8.1_ and WT in both ovary and fruit (Table 2).
In the abaxial– adaxial direction, _fs8.1_ significantly increased the number of cell layers and this was sometimes associated with pericarp thickness (Table 2).
With respect to cell size, no significant difference was observed in ovary wall and columella in either the proximal–distal or the mediolateral direction.
However,    in the mature fruit pericarp, the average cell size in _fs8.1_ was decreased in both the proximal–distal and mediolateral direction (Table 2).
Thus, the increase in cell number was offset by a decrease in cell size in the _fs8.1_ fruit.
fs8.1 _decreases tryptophan and tryptamine levels in_ _
anthesis-stage ovaries_
The hormone auxin is hypothesized to regulate proximal–distal patterning of the pistil and ovary (Nemhauser _et al._, 2000).
**6478 |** Sun _et al._
Moreover, certain genes within the introgression region have been hypothesized to be involved in auxin metabolism.
Therefore, we conducted targeted metabolomic profiling of auxin and auxin metabolites in _fs8.1_ and WT ovaries.
While indole-3-acetic acid was consistently below the level of detection in this organ, we noticed a decrease in the amount of its precursors, tryptophan and tryptamine, in _fs8.1_ ovaries to [88.06 and 81.69% of that of WT, respectively (Supplementary](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1)
[Fig.
S2A, B, available at](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) _JXB_ online).
However, even though this trend was found in five out of six experiments, the values varied among experiments and were barely or not significant, and therefore the results should be interpreted with caution.
Interestingly, the ratio of tryptophan to tryptamine was not different between WT and _fs8.1_ .
This suggested that the conversion of tryptophan to tryptamine was apparently not altered in _fs8.1_
[(Supplementary Fig. S2C).](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1)
**Discussion**   _
Molecular basis of the_ fs8.1 _
locus_
To genetically identify the underlying genes at loci of interest depends on the heritability of the trait, ease of trait evaluation, and recombination frequencies.
Centromere and pericentromeric heterochromatin have been shown to be strong suppressors of meiotic recombination (Beadle, 1932; Mather, 1939; Roberts, 1965;
Tanksley _et al._, 1992; Li _et al._, 2004).
Thus, genetically mapping a gene that is located in recombinationsuppressed regions will always be a challenge.
In this study, we were fortunate to find a rare recombinant plant that narrowed the region to 3.03 Mb on a single scaffold that appeared to **Fig.

Because the effect of _fs8.1_ is clearly final at anthesis (Fig. 5; Ku _et al._, 2000), genes that were not expressed in anthesis-stage ovaries (our RNA-Seq dataset)
but in inflorescence and floral meristems, or in young flower buds, were also likely candidates.
Those genes that were only expressed in anthesis ovaries ( _Solyc08g061880_, _Solyc08g061950_, and _Solyc08g062690_ ) or vegetative meristem ( _Solyc08g061570_, _Solyc08g062220_, and _Solyc08g062780_ ) were not likely _
fs8.1_ candidate genes and were eliminated from the candidate gene list (Fig. 3, [Supplementary Table S5).
Thus,](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) 45 expressed genes passed and made up the preliminary list of candidates of _fs8.1_
[(Fig. 3, Supplementary Table S5).
As](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1)
_
fs8.1_ could be based on a mutation leading to gene expression change, five genes ( _Solyc08g061650_, _Solyc08g062340_, _Solyc08g062370_, _Solyc08g062450_, and _Solyc08g062580_ ) were selected as highly likely candidate genes primarily because of their differential expression between anthesis-stage ovaries carrying _fs8.1_ and the WT allele (Fig. 3, Table 3).
One of these genes, _Solyc08g061650_, was the only one that was upregulated in anthesis-stage ovaries of _fs8.1_, encoding a LRR domain-containing protein with an unknown func[tion (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table S5).
Moreover, two SNPs](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) were identified in the putative promoter region of this gene, which might enhance its expression (Fig. 4, [Supplementary](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1)
[Table S4).](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) _
Solyc08g062580_ encodes a member of the pentatricopeptide repeat protein (PPR) family.
The gene was downregulated not only in our _fs8.1_ NIL RNA-Seq dataset but also in another RNA-Seq dataset generated from the smallest flower buds of an _fs8.1_ NIL in the LA1589 background (Fig. 3, [Supplementary Table S5; Y. Wang, S. Wu,](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) and E. van der Knaap, unpublished).
For the other three differentially expressed genes, both _Solyc08g062340_ and _Solyc08g062450_ encoded 17.6 kDa class II small heat-shock   **Table 3.** _

| **6479**   proteins, whereas _Solyc08g062370_ encoded an orthologue of AtSRG1 (Senescence-Related Gene 1).
Moreover, a SNP was identified in the putative promoter region of _Solyc08g062370_, which further indicated the potential of this gene to control [fruit shape (Fig. 4, Supplementary Table S4).
In addition to](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) the candidate genes listed above, mutations leading to amino acid sequence changes could also result in _fs8.1_ .
Three genes ( _Solyc08g061850_, _Solyc08g061910_, and _Solyc08g062200_ ) were selected as highly likely candidate genes based mainly on the mutations in the coding region (Table 3).
_Solyc08g061850_ encoded a ribosomal protein S3 harbouring a non-synonymous change from asparagine (N) to aspartic acid (D) at residue 253 (N253D); _Solyc08g061910_ encoded an orthologue of potato GTL2-like trihelix transcription factor and harboured a premature stop codon, which would lead to a null mutation; and _Solyc08g062200_ encoded an unknown protein and harboured a mutation in the natural stop codon, which could lead [to a 109 aa extension of the protein (Fig. 4, Supplementary](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1)

fs8.1 _represents a different mechanism of regulating_ _tomato fruit shape when compared with other fruit_ _
elongation genes_
The genes _SUN_ and _OVATE_ control tomato fruit elongation.
Compared with WT, _ovate_ primarily increases the fruit proximal end by increasing cell number in the proximal–distal direction and decreasing cell number in the mediolateral direction leading to a pear-shaped fruit (Liu _et al._, 2002; van der Knaap _et al._, 2002; Rodríguez _et al._, 2011; Y. Wang, S. Wu, and E. van der Knaap, unpublished).
The _sun_ gene, on the other hand, results in long fruit by increasing cell number along the entire proximal–distal direction in the pericarp and columella while decreasing cell number in mediolateral direction in the columella and septum (Wu _et al._, 2011).

**6480 |** Sun _et al._   alter fruit weight (Wu _et al._, 2011), whereas _ovate_ leads to a slight reduction in fruit weight (Wu _et al._, 2015).
Compared with _sun_ and _ovate_, _fs8.1_ showed a cellular patterning that was different from the effect of the other two genes: _fs8.1_ led to increased fruit shape by increased cell number in the proximal– distal direction without a change in the mediolateral direction (Table 2).
This also led to an increase in fruit weight, albeit [not always significant (Supplementary Tables S2 and S8).](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1)
The altered fruit shape was final at anthesis implying that the _fs8.1_ pattern is set up during development of the ovary in the flower.
This is in contrast to _SUN_, which has been shown to impact ovary shape slightly before anthesis, while the most dramatic shape change occurs immediately after anthesis (van der Knaap and Tanksley, 2001; Xiao _et al._, 2009; Wu _et al._, 2015).
Since _fs8.1_ appeared to regulate reproductive organ shape by regulating cell number, four genes from the candidate list ( _Solyc08g061560_, _Solyc08g061930_, _Solyc08g061820_, and _Solyc08g062630_ ) could be selected based on their putative functions in the control of organ shape and phytohormones
[levels (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S5).](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) _Solyc08g061560_ encoded a putative orthologue of ERECTA, a LRR receptor-like kinase with functions of regulating cell division, meristem size, fruit morphology, and inflorescence architecture in _Arabidopsis_ (Torii _et al._, 1996; Lease _et al._, 2001; Shpak _et al._, 2003; Woodward _et al._, 2005; Mandel _et al._, 2014).
_
Solyc08g061930_ encoded a putative orthologue of an _Arabidopsis_ cytokinin oxidase, which has been shown to control cytokinin level and regulate reproductive meristem, flower organ, and fruit sizes by impacting cell number in _
Arabidopsis_ (Bartrina _et al._, 2011; Köllmer _et al._, 2014).
_
Solyc08g061820_ encoded a putative orthologue of SLOMO (SLOW MOTION) in _Arabidopsis_, which is an F-box protein involved in the maintenance of a normal plastochron by regulating auxin homeostasis (Lohmann _et al._, 2010).
_Solyc08g062630_ encoded a putative orthologue of an _Arabidopsis_ aminopeptidase M1-like protein involved in the regulation of auxin polar transport, cell cycle, and seedling development (Peer _et al._, 2009).
Therefore, although there was no evidence at the transcriptional and genome sequence level, these genes were still considered likely candidates for _fs8.1_ because of their putative functions.
Of the eight candidate genes that were selected based predominantly on gene expression and genome sequence variations, three of them, according to their putative functions, were deemed the most likely candidate genes.
The first one was _Solyc08g062580_, encoding a member of PPR family, which represents a large protein family in land plant species.
PPR family members are involved in the regulation of various aspects of plant development by regulating organellar gene expression (Lurin _et al._, 2004; Petricka _et al._, 2008; Barkan and Small, 2014).
Moreover, a member of the PPR family, At4g18750, has been reported to impact plant morphology, and a knockout of this gene led to a mutant with small size and narrow or pin-shaped leaves, and a disrupted primary vein (Petricka _et al._, 2008).
In addition, _Solyc08g061650_ encoded a member of the LRR domain-containing family, which is also a large family that has been implicated in the regulation of a wide variety of developmental and defence-related processes    (Torii, 2004; Choi _et al._, 2011; Torti _et al._, 2012).
The last gene was _Solyc08g061910_, which harboured a probable null mutation and encoded an orthologue of potato GTL2-like trihelix transcription factor.
Members of this family in _Arabidopsis_ have been reported to regulate perianth architecture, cell growth in trichomes, and responses to cold and salt stresses (Brewer _et al._, 2004; Breuer _et al._, 2009; Xi _et al._, 2012).
In summary and based on the analyses conducted in this study, 12 genes were selected to be the most likely candidates underlying the _fs8.1_ locus (Table 3).
However, none of them stood out.
The gene expression, genome sequence variation, and putative function analyses were performed based on the annotated genes and without evaluation of putative structural variants that often underlie morphological diversity (van der Knaap _et al._, 2014).
Moreover, there are many gaps in the reference genome sequence that may harbour additional genes including _FS8.1_
[(Supplementary](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1)
[Table S4).
Gene action analysis in this and previous studies](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) showed that the WT allele was partial dominant for fruit shape index (D/A=–0.47 in this study), while the _fs8.1_ allele was partial or overdominant for fruit weight (D/A=1.14 in this study; Grandillo _et al._, 1996), suggesting that more than one gene could underlie this locus.
Therefore, transgenic complementation using genomic constructs of one, several, or all 12 candidate genes may be required to definitively identify the molecular basis of _fs8.1_ .
However, as _fs8.1_
[segregates in cultivated tomatoes (Supplementary](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1)
[Table S6), and with an improved tomato genome sequence](http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv361/-/DC1) underway, association mapping could be employed in the near future to ultimately identify the most likely candidate gene(s) followed by confirmation that includes plant transformations.
