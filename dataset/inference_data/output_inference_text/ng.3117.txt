**    Global food production relies heavily on the capacity and effective­ ness of plant breeding [1] .
More than 10,000 years ago, our Neolithic ancestors successfully domesticated hundreds of wild plant species into cultivated crops that remain principal human food sources [2,3] .
Domestication can be regarded as the first stage of plant breeding and is often followed by species distribution along corridors of human migration.
Migration and subsequent differential selection by local farmers likely contributed to geographical differences in preferences for cultivated species and traits [4] .
Until recently, crop breeding has relied heavily on accumulated experience and careful observation.
The current genomic era, enabled by next-generation DNA sequencing technologies, offers new and powerful tools for targeted and precise selection.
Scientists can now ‘read’ entire genomes during selection and track the history of plant breeding via population genomics, as recently demonstrated in rice
[5], maize [6], soybean
[7] and cucumber
[8] .
These studies illustrate how human-involved evolutionary processes have shaped modern crop genomes and provide insights for further crop improvement.
Tomato ( _Solanum lycopersicum_ ) has a worldwide distribution and is considered the leading vegetable crop, with a global yield of 162 mil­ lion tons in 2012 (United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) statistics; see URLs) and a net value of over $55 billion [9] .
Tomato is also an important model system for plants and especially for fleshy fruit biology [10] .
It represents the cornerstone for biological research on and genetic improvement of all solanaceous crops, including potato, pepper and eggplant.
Tomato and its wild relatives originated from the Andean region of South America.
Cherry tomato ( _S_ .
_
lycopersicum_ var.
_cerasiforme_ ) is considered the probable ancestor of the big-fruited tomato and was likely domesticated from the red-fruited wild species _Solanum pimpinellifolium_
[11] .
Tomatoes were brought to Europe by the conquistadors in the sixteenth century [12], and subsequent migration and continued selection reduced the genetic diversity of this crop.
To further boost the performance of modern tomato cultivars, wild tomato genomes were deliberately introgressed into elite cultivars [13] .
However, how human selection has changed the tomato genome remains largely unknown.

We constructed a genomic history of tomato breeding by analyz­ ing the genomes of 360 diverse accessions collected from around the world.
These included 333 accessions from the red-fruited clade  ( _S. pimpinellifolium_, _S. lycopersicum_ var.
_cerasiforme_ and _S. lycoper­_ _sicum_ ) representing various geographical origins, consumption types and improvement statuses, 10 accessions of wild tomato species including some known donors of disease resistance genes ( _R_ genes) and 17 modern commercial hybrids (F 1 ) ( **Supplementary** **Table 1** ).
Resequencing of the 360 accessions generated a total of 2.6 trillion base pairs of sequence, with a median depth of 5.7× and coverage of 93.1% of the assembled genome [14] (release SL2.40) ( **Supplementary Table 1** ).
After aligning the reads against the tomato reference genome, we generated a final set of 11,620,517 SNPs and 1,303,213 small indels (shorter than 5 bp) ( **Supplementary Tables 2** and **3** ).
The accuracy of the identified SNPs was estimated to be 98.4% and 97.6% using Sanger sequencing (349 SNPs in 3 acces­ sions) and existing SNP array data
[15] (48 accessions with an average of 5,800 SNPs), respectively ( **Supplementary Tables 4** and **5**, and **Supplementary Note** ).
We identified 207,306 nonsynonymous SNPs in 30,945 genes, including 12,035 nonsense SNPs in 7,678 genes that caused start codon changes, the introduction of premature stop codons or the production of elongated transcripts.
This SNP data set represents a new resource for tomato biology and breeding.
We explored the phylogenetic relationships among the accessions using 20,111 SNPs (minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.05) at fourfolddegenerate sites that represent neutral or near-neutral variants.
The resulting neighbor-joining tree ( **Fig. 1a** ) supports the clustering of the red-fruited clade.
Interestingly, three _Solanum cheesmaniae_ acces­ sions and one _Solanum galapagense_ accession were situated within this clade, consistent with previous studies [16] .
These two species bear small mature fruits (2–3 g) of yellow or red color.
Endemic to the Galapagos Islands, they can be experimentally crossed to _S. lycopersicum_ without difficulty.
On the basis of passport informa­ tion, fruit weight and other morphological traits, we assigned the 331 red-fruited acces­ **a** sions to 3 groups (2 accessions could not be assigned as fruit weight was highly segregated within each accession): PIM including 53 _S. pimpinellifolium_ accessions (fruit weight = 2.04 ± 0.85 g), CER including 112 _S. lycopersicum_    **A rt
i c l e s**   var.
_cerasiforme_ accessions (fruit weight = 13.29 ± 9.54 g) and BIG including 166 big-fruited _S. lycopersicum_ accessions (fruit weight = 111.33 ± 68.19 g) ( **Supplementary Fig.
1** ).
The neighbor-joining tree largely supported this division, although some discrepancies between phenotypic characterization and phylogenetic clustering can be anticipated due to shared ancestral variation and historical gene flow among these very closely related groups ( **Fig.
1a** ).
For instance, some cherry tomatoes residing in the BIG group could be the feral descend­ ants of cultivated tomatoes or the products of introgression between the groups, as previously hypothesized [17] .
Model-based clustering analyses ( **Fig.
1b
** and **Supplementary** **Figs.
2** and **3** ) enabled the division of the CER group into two main clusters.
One cluster showed obvious admixture in genetic compo­ sition and consisted of 49 accessions mainly distributed in South America, where CER accessions might experience occasional gene flows with the local wild relative _S. pimpinellifolium_ .
Another cluster was homogeneous with the BIG group in genetic composition and contained 38 accessions mainly of non–South American origin (from Mesoamerica, Europe, North America and Asia).
Within the BIG group, we identified a cluster of processing tomatoes, highlighting their genetic similarity and distinction from other accessions ( **Fig.
1b
** ).
Nucleotide diversity measured by the π value
[18] for the PIM group (3.23 × 10
[−3] ) was substantially higher than that for the CER (1.74 × 10
[−3] )
and BIG (0.73 × 10 [−3] ) groups.
In addition, the PIM group had more private SNPs (582,954) than the CER (207,892) and BIG (194,919) groups.
We aligned the _Solanum pennellii_ genome
[19] to the reference Heinz 1706 genome.
Of the ~11.6 million SNP sites, ~3.5 million could be reliably recovered in the _S. pennellii_ genome.
Among the ~3.5 million SNPs, on average, 30.4% of the sites in PIM accessions, 6.6% of the sites in CER accessions and 2.8% of the sites in BIG accessions were identical to the corresponding _S. pennellii_ sites that are presumably ancestral alleles.
The decay of linkage disequilib­ rium (LD) with physical distance between SNPs occurred at 8.8 kb in PIM ( _r_
[2] = 0.2), 256.8 kb in CER ( _r_
[2] = 0.35) and 865.7 kb in BIG      _S. habrochaites_    PI 247087    **a**    TS-407              **Figure 1** Genome-wide relationship and fruit morphology in cultivated tomato and its wild relatives.

Overall, **h** _fw1.1fw5.2fw7.2_ port the PIM group as the ancestor of the red-fruited clade and the CER group as the evolutionary intermediate between PIM and BIG, consistent with a previous report [20] .
We  PIM  therefore define the evolutionary processes 2.04 ± 0.85 g yielding the CER group from PIM as ‘domes­ tication’ and yielding the BIG group from CER as ‘improvement’.
Demographic modeling using δaδi [21] suggested an effective popula­ tion size of ~300 for tomato at domestication, an estimate similar to that for cucumber
[8] ( **Supplementary Table 6** ).

It is well known that the indigenous people of the Andes domesticated quinoa, lima bean, peanut, potato, sweet potato and squash [2] .
They likely also kept and propagated seeds from wild tomato plants with bigger and tastier fruits.
Fruit mass is the key trait of human selec­ tion in tomato, as it affects both yield and quality.
Typical fruits from PIM lines are tiny and have a thick skin, thin pericarp and high seed content ( **Fig.
2** ).
Previous reports on segregating populations from crosses between PIM and BIG accessions identified multiple QTLs for fruit mass, including several genes that were cloned [22–25] .
However, whether these QTLs and genes were selected during domestication or improvement remains elusive.
To address this question, we scanned    genomic regions with a drastic reduction in nucleotide diversity in the comparison of PIM and CER lines (π PIM /π CER ; domestication sweeps) as well as in the comparison of CER and BIG lines (
π CER /π BIG ; improvement sweeps).
In total, we identified 186 domestication sweeps and 133 improvement sweeps covering 8.3% (64.6 Mb) and 7.0% (54.5 Mb) of the assembled genome, harboring 5,605 and 4,807 genes, respectively ( **Fig.
2a**, **b** and **Supplementary Tables 7** – **10** ).
We note that 21% of the domestication sweeps overlapped with improve­ ment sweeps (8.0 Mb; 1.0% of the genome), indicating that some of the domestication loci might have undergone a second round of selection for further increase in fruit size and improvement of other agronomic traits.
Jointly, the domestication and improvement sweeps occupied 111.0 Mb (14.2% of the assembled genome).
Five QTLs ( **Supplementary Table 11** ) related to fruit mass ( _fw1.1_, _fw5.2_, _fw7.2_, _fw12.1_ and _lcn12.1_ ) are located within the domestication sweeps and likely contributed to the enlargement of tomato fruits during the evolutionary transition from PIM to CER lines ( **Fig.
2a** ).

Exons are depicted as black blocks.
The numbers of tomato accessions with the six genotypes (I–VI) are given.
Note that genotypes II and IV are recombinants between SNP _y_ and the 603-bp deletion.
For instance, the _fw12.1_ QTL resides in a domestication sweep span­ ning the telomeric region of the short arm of chromosome 12 ( **Fig.
2c** ).
Its signature marker, TG180, is physically close to the _Solyc12g005310_ gene that encodes a putative auxin-responsive GH3-like protein with predominant expression in flower buds, making it a logical candidate for the gene corresponding to _fw12.1_ (ref. 26).
We detected 13 QTLs ( **Supplementary Table 11** ) located within improvement sweeps that might have contributed to the second round of fruit enlargement during the CER-to-BIG transition ( **Fig.
2b** ).
Remarkably, a major improvement sweep spanned a 10.3-Mb region at the distal end of the long arm of chromosome 2, where two fruit mass QTLs ( _fw2.2_ and _lcn2.1_ ) were cloned and three others ( _fw2.1_, _fw2.3_ and _lcn2.2_ ) were mapped ( **Fig.
2d
** ).
Selection for these QTLs in the BIG group might be causative of the low genetic diversity in this region (π = 0.22 × 10
[−3] in the 10-Mb region versus 0.73 × 10 [–3] in the whole genome).
The gene _fw2.2_ controls carpel cell number and contributes sub­ stantially to the evolution of tomato fruit mass and size [24] .
However, its causative variation remains undetermined.
We exploited the SNP data set to perform a local association study around _fw2.2_ for allelic varia­ tion conferring the phenotypic change.
A SNP in the promoter region (−912 bp relative to the start codon) showed a signal ( _P_ < 1 × 10
[−3] ) that was almost fixed in BIG accessions (97.3%)
but not in CER acces­ sions (66.7%).
In PIM accessions, it was a minor allele (2.6%).
Taking this finding together with the fact that _fw2.2_ is not located within a domestication sweep, we infer that _
fw2.2_ is more likely an improve­ ment rather than a domestication gene.
The same held true for two other cloned QTLs: _lcn2.1_, which contributes to increased locule number [25], and _fw3.2_, which corresponds to a cytochrome P450 gene controlling fruit cell number
[22] .
The SNP for _fw2.2_ could be developed as a marker for selecting recombinants to break apart the improve­ ment sweep and to introduce new variations into this region for modern tomato breeding.
To further verify improvement sweeps related to fruit mass, we sequenced 2 bulk populations with extreme fruit size, each con­ sisting of 50 progenies from an F 2 population of 500 individuals from a cross between the CER and BIG lines, to a depth of 50× ( **Fig.
2e**, **Supplementary Fig. 6** and **Supplementary Note** ).
We called SNPs between two parental genomes, and we computed the SNP indices for the big-fruited and small-fruited bulk populations as well as their differences (∆SNP index) using a 1,000-kb sliding window with a step size of 10 kb.
This analysis led to the identification of four genomic regions contributing to fruit mass, all of which overlapped with previously identified improvement sweeps, i.e., the chromosome 2 distal end carrying _fw2.1_, _fw2.2_, _fw2.3_, _lcn2.1_ and _lcn2.2_, both distal ends of chromosome 9 carrying _fw9.1_ and _fw9.3_, and the distal end of the long arm of chromosome 11 carrying _fw11.1_, _fw11.2_ and _fw11.3_ ( **Fig.
2f**, **g** ).
To summarize, we propose a two-step evolu­ tion of fruit mass that involved two different sets of loci ( **Fig.
2h** ),    which jointly gave rise to modern tomatoes about 100 times larger in fruit size than their wild ancestor.
**Divergence in big-fruited tomatoes**
After domestication in South America, tomatoes were dispersed to other parts of the world and selected by local farmers and breeders.
In general, big-fruited tomatoes were bred for fresh consumption or for processing into tomato paste.
Modern processing tomatoes have several characteristic traits, including determinate growth for homogeneous fruit setting and harvest
[27], jointless pedicel [28], increased firmness for mechanical harvest, and higher soluble solid content (SSC) and lycopene content for processing quality.
However, the genomewide genetic basis underlying the divergence between tomatoes for fresh consumption and processing tomatoes was not previously studied.
To search for SNPs underlying this divergence, we computed the population differentiation statistic ( _F_ ST ) of each SNP site for 22 mod­ ern processing accessions and the remaining 144 BIG accessions.
We observed a non-random distribution of highly divergent sites (the top 1% had _F_ ST ≥ 0.4464; the genome average was 0.07).
Intriguingly, 90.53% (63,009 of 69,603) of these sites resided on chromosome 5 ( **Fig.
3a** ), spanning the majority of the chromosome (from 3.5 to 62.8 Mb).
We note that a previous study identified three SSC QTLs ( _ssc5.1_, _ssc5.2_ and _ssc5.3_ ) located on the short arm, in the centromeric region and on the long arm of chromosome 5, respectively [29] .
A major fruit firmness QTL, _fir5.1_, also resides in the centromeric region of chromosome 5 (ref. 30).
In addition, the chromosome has a large centromere with a length of ~50 Mb, extending from 10 to 60 Mb on the assembled chromosome [14] .
Therefore, selection of the QTLs for higher SSC and better fruit firmness likely resulted in the hitchhiking of almost the entire chromosome 5, representing a genomic signature of modern processing tomatoes.
Red-fruited tomatoes are widely consumed, but pink-fruited toma­ toes are especially popular in China and Japan
[31] .
Two independent studies [31,32] demonstrated that the pink gene _y_ on chromosome 1 corresponds to _SlMYB12_, which controls the accumulation of yellow-colored flavonoid (naringenin chalcone) in the tomato fruit epidermis (peels from pink fruit are colorless owing to the absence    **a**   **b**   **c**    1.0   0.8   0.6   0.4   0.2   0   35   30   25   20   15   10   5   0

To identify the allelic I variation underlying this phenotype, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 231 tomato accessions with known phenotypes.
The strongest association signal (SNP _y_, _P_ < 1 × 10
[−32] ) resided 8,616 bp F upstream of the start codon of _SlMYB12_ ( **Fig.
3b** ).
We further analyzed the upstream and downstream sequences of the target gene for structural variants and discovered a 603-bp deletion in the upstream region P of _SlMYB12_ (−4,865 bp relative to the start codon) that was present in most pink-fruited accessions ( **Fig.
3c** ).
Among 205 red-fruited accessions and 122 pink-fruited ones (96 additional pink-fruited accessions were added for this analysis), the 603-bp deletion coincided with the phenotype in all but 4 accessions.
We sequenced the genic regions of _SlMYB12_ in these four accessions and identified two nonsense mutations (a nucleotide substitution (C>T) and a 1-bp insertion (TG>TAG)), both resulting in the introduction of premature stop codons.
It is noteworthy that the 603-bp deletion was more diag­ nostic than SNP _y_, as two recombinants were found (genotype II and IV in **Fig.
3c** ).
We hypothesize that the deletion might impair the tran­ scription of _SlMYB12_, whose expression is silenced in pink fruits [32] .
The silencing of _SlMYB12_ likely relaxed purifying selection in the coding sequence, which could accumulate more deleterious mutations as observed.
The three recessive alleles of the _y_ gene represent useful markers for pink tomato breeding.

9    **Wild introgressions** Domestication and improvement have increased tomato produc­ tivity as well as narrowed its genetic basis.
In recent decades, wild germplasm has increasingly been used as a source of new alleles for tomato breeding.
These efforts rely largely on the pioneering research and comprehensive germplasm collections of Charles Rick at the University of California, Davis [33] .
As an example, resistance genes ( _R_ genes) introgressed from wild species are necessary for the success of modern commercial cultivars.
To determine how introgression changed the tomato genome, we scanned all accessions in the CER and BIG lines and the 17 F 1 hybrids for genome regions similar to those    in wild accessions ( **Fig.
4** ).
We detected a large exotic fragment on chromosome 9 (51.7–54.7 Mb in length) carrying the tomato mosaic virus resistance gene _Tm-2_ _
[a]_ derived from _Solanum peruvianum_
[34] (PI 128650).
In addition, there were two major introgressions on chromosome 6: one (26.6–27.7 Mb in length) carrying the root knot nematode resistance gene _Mi-1_ from _S. peruvianum_
[35] (PI 128657) and the other (30.9–32.5 Mb in lengths) carrying the tomato yellow leaf curl virus resistance gene _Ty-1_ from _Solanum chilense_
[36] (LA1969).
Both introgressions occupied nearly the same genomic region, making it difficult to recombine both genes into a single cultivar.
Even after multiple generations of backcrossing, these introgressed fragments remain intact, possibly owing to chromosomal inversions or a centromeric location that would inhibit recombination, as shown in the case of _Ty-1_ and _Mi-1_ (refs. 36,37).
An introgression from _
Solanum habrochaites_ carrying the _AgpL1_ gene on chromosome 1, which enhances SSC in mature fruits, was observed in four modern processing hybrids ( **Fig.
4** ).
Understanding the precise position and size of these large wild introgressions will enable the deployment of molecular markers to minimize the limitation from linkage drag and maximize the potential of wild germplasm.
Intriguingly, introgressions carrying resistance genes showed relatively low overlap with the genomic locations of domestication and improvement sweeps ( **Fig. 4** ).
Only one 4.1-Mb region out of the 92.2 Mb of introgressions ( _Mi-1_, _Ty-1_, _Tm-2_ _
[a]_, _Sw-5_ and _AgpL1_ )    **1224** VOLUME 46 | NUMBER 11 | NOVEMBER 2014 **Nature Genetics**   overlapped with the domestication and improvement sweeps (4.5% in comparison to the genome level of 14.2%; _
P_ = 0.01), indicating that introgressions are less likely to have occurred within swept regions.
For the three cloned fruit mass genes ( _fw2.2_, _fw3.2_ and _lcn2.1_ ), gene action was either recessive or additive [22,24,25], requiring both ‘big’ alleles for full phenotypic penetration.
This could also be true for other domestication and improvement genes [38] .
Therefore, it may prove difficult to introgress new alleles into swept regions, implying that domestication and improvement bear a cost in terms of potential future improvement.
**DISCUSSION**
The genomic foundation for modern tomato breeding was shaped by human-involved selection, as illustrated in this study.
Despite their historical contribution to desirable phenotypic traits, these human-induced processes also resulted in the near fixation of a large proportion of the tomato genome.
As shown, the domestica­ tion and improvement sweeps and linkage drags associated with introgression jointly occupy nearly 200 Mb (25.6% of the assembled genome), limiting further improvement via conventional breed­ ing.
The genome sequence [14] and the variation map generated here will facilitate the separation of genes for favorable traits from their embedded sweeps and linkage drags by variome-guided selection for rare recombination or possibly by genome editing.
These efforts should enable a redesign of the genomic foundation for future tomato breeding.

A total of 360 tomato accessions were collected from TGRC (Tomato Genetics Resource Center), USDA (US Department of Agriculture), EU-SOL (European Union Solanaceae project), INRA (National Institute for Agricultural Research) and IVF-CAAS (Institute of Vegetables and Flowers, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science).
These accessions included 10 wild tomato accessions (1 _S. habrochaites_, 3 _S. cheesmaniae_, 1 _S. galapagense_, 3 _S. peruvianum_, 1 _Solanum neorickii_ and 1 _S. chilense_ ), 53 PIM accessions, 112 CER accessions, 166 BIG accessions (2 accessions were excluded for extreme phenotype segregation) and 17 modern com­ mercial hybrids (F 1 ) ( **Supplementary Table 1** ).
Tomato plants were grown in the greenhouses of IVF-CAAS, Beijing, and the Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.
Genomic DNA was extracted from young leaves using the cetyltriethylammnonium bromide (CTAB) method
[39] .
At least 5 µg of genomic DNA was used for each accession to construct paired-end sequencing libraries with insert sizes of approximately 500 bp according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina).
We generated more than 5 Gb of sequence data for each accession with 100-bp paired-end reads using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.
**Mapping and variation calling.
**
To call SNPs, we used SOAP2 (ref. 40) to map all the sequence reads from each accession to the tomato reference genome [14] (release SL2.40) with the following parameters: -m 100, -x 888, -s 35, -l 32, -v 3.
Mapped reads were filtered to remove PCR duplicates, assigned to the chro­ mosomes and sorted according to mapping coordinates.
Both paired-end and single-end mapped reads were then used for SNP detection throughout the entire collection of tomato accessions via the following procedures.
Scripts and analysis pipelines for the SNP data set are available in **Supplementary** **Data Set** .
To identify SNPs for each genotype, we identified possible SNPs for each acces­ sion relative to the reference using SOAPsnp
[41] with the following parameters: L 100 -u -F 1.
The likelihood of each individual’s genotype in glf format was then generated for each chromosome with SNP quality ≥ 40 and base quality ≥40.
To integrate SNPs across the entire collection, we called each SNP using GLFmulti on the basis of the maximum-likelihood estimation of site frequency.
The core set of SNPs was then obtained by filtering according to site frequency and the quality score given by GLFmulti.
These SNPs were further filtered using the following criteria: (i) one position with more than two alleles was considered to be a polymorphic site in the population; (ii) the total sequencing depth had to be >150× and <3,500× and the SNP quality value had to be greater than 40; (iii) positions with an average mapping rate of reads of less than 1.5 were retained to rule out the effect of duplications; and (iv) the nearest SNPs had to be more than 1 bp away.
To obtain the final set of SNPs, we performed filtering on the basis of seg­ regation tests and the proportion of homozygosity.
Segregation tests can dis­ tinguish any segregation pattern from random sequencing errors on the basis of the sequencing depth of the two putative alleles in different individuals.
We thus performed segregation tests on the contingency table of read depth for SNP alleles from the 360 tomato accessions.
Permutations were used to  determine the significance of allele depth in the population, and only sites with _P_ < 0.01 were retained.
In addition, we filtered out sites at which fewer than 85% of the lines appeared to be homozygous and sites with a proportion of heterozygous genotypes greater than three times that of the homozygous genotypes with the minor allele.
Finally, to detect small indels (≤5 bp in length), we mapped all the sequence reads from each accession with a gap of less than 5 bp allowed (parameter -g 5) using SOAP2 (ref. 40).
Indels (1–5 bp) were called by the SOAPindel pipeline (see URLs).
**Annotation of SNPs.
**
The identified SNPs were further categorized as varia­ tions in intergenic regions, UTRs, coding sequences and introns according to the tomato genome annotation (release ITAG2.3).
SNPs in coding sequences were further grouped into synonymous SNPs (not causing amino acid changes) and nonsynonymous SNPs (causing amino acid changes) ( **Supplementary Table 2** ).
**Evaluation of SNPs.
**
We used Sanger sequencing and previously released SNP array data to evaluate the accuracy of SNPs.
First, we randomly selected 349 SNPs    from 3 tomato accessions (PIM, TS-244; CER, TS-252; BIG, TS-137) for valida­ tion by PCR and Sanger sequencing.
Second, we compared 285,508 SNPs for 48 tomato accessions identified in this study to previously published tomato SNP array data [15] ( **Supplementary Tables 4** and **5**, and **Supplementary Note** ).
**Phylogenetic analysis and population structure of tomato.
**
To build a neighbor-joining tree, we screened a subset of 20,111 SNPs at fourfolddegenerate sites (MAF > 5% and missing data < 10%) in the 341 tomato accessions (excluding the F 1 individuals) from the entire SNP data set.
These SNPs should be under less selective pressure, thus more reliably reflecting population structure and demography.
We constructed a phylogenetic tree using PHYLIP [42] (version 3.695) with 100 bootstrap replicates.
Using the same data set, we also investigated the population structure using STRUCTURE
[43] (version 2.3.1) on the basis of allele frequencies.
To determine the most likely group number, STRUCTURE was run 20 times on 1,000 randomly selected SNPs at fourfold-degenerate sites for each _K_ value from 2 to 19 ( **Supplementary** **Fig.
2** ).
After determining ∆ _K_, we used 20,111 SNPs at fourfold-degenerate sites to determine the group membership of each accession by 10,000 iterations with _K_ values from 2 to 4.
In addition, we performed principal-component analysis (PCA)
[44] using 2,340,973 SNPs across the genome (MAF > 10%, missing < 5%).
Two-dimensional coordinates were plotted for the 331 tomato accessions (excluding 10 wild accessions)
( **Supplementary Fig.
3** ).
**Demographic analysis of tomato evolution history.
**
The best parameters for fitting were estimated using δ _a_ δ _i_
[21] .
We fitted the three-population model with PIM and BIG mixed together ( **Supplementary Table 6** ) for all three groups.
The simulation was carried out 20 times, and each time we randomly selected 500,000 SNPs and estimated 95% confidence intervals on the basis of the best fitting parameters.
The parameters inferred by δ _a_ δ _i_ were scaled by 2 _N_ e, with _N_ e being the ancestral population size.
We estimated the ancestral population size using the formula 4 _N_ e
× µ × _
L_ = θ, where µ is the mutation rate, _L_ is the generation time and θ is the genetic diversity.
We used θ PIM to estimate θ (set to ~3.23
× 10
[−3] ).
Here the neutral mutation rate of 1 × 10 [−8] (ref. 45) was used for µ (the mutation rate per generation).
Thus, 2 _N_ e was estimated to be 1.615 × 10 [5] .
All the parameters were then scaled by 2 _N_ e to estimate time in years and the population size in number of individuals.
**Detection of domestication and improvement sweeps.
** Nucleotide diversity (π) is often applied to measure the degree of variability in a group [18] .
To identify genomic regions affected by domestication and improvement, two key stages in tomato evolution, we first measured the level of genetic diversity (π) using a 100-kb window with a step size of 10 kb in PIM, CER and BIG.
The regions affected by domestication should have substantially lower diversity in CER than in PIM.
Improvement sweeps should show a much stronger reduction of diver­ sity in BIG in comparison to CER.
If π PIM for a window was lower than 0.002 in domestication analysis and π CER was lower than 0.001 in improvement analy­ sis, then the window was excluded.
By scanning the ratios of genetic diversity between PIM and CER (π PIM /π CER ) as well as between CER and BIG (π CER / π BIG ), we selected windows with the top 5% of ratios (3.0 and 6.9 for domestica­ tion and improvement, respectively) as candidate regions for further analysis.
Finally, windows that were ≤100
kb apart were merged into a single selected region ( **Supplementary Tables 7–10** ).
To verify the empirical thresholds with low false discovery rate, we performed whole-genome permutation tests to ascertain the thresholds for identifying domestication and improvement sweeps ( **Supplementary Note** ).
The regions shared by domestication and improvement sweeps were defined as overlapping regions, and these regions should have under­ gone further selection during improvement.
In our study, we analyzed almost all the fruit mass QTLs and genes that segregated between PIM parents and culti­ vated parents.
If closely linked markers or the mapped intervals were located in domestication (improvement) sweeps, we considered them to be candidate domestication (improvement) QTLs or genes ( **Supplementary Table 11** ).
**Linkage disequilibrium analysis.
** LD values for PIM, CER and BIG were calculated on the basis of SNPs (MAF > 0.05) using Haploview software [46] .
The parameters were as follows: -n -pedfile -info -log -minMAF 0.05 -hwcutoff 0 -dprime -memory 2096.

We planted an F 2 population of 500 individuals derived from the cross between TS-400 (a big-fruit accession) and TS-my (a small-fruit accession) in the fall of 2013 in IVF-CAAS, China.
For each individual, the average weight of approximately ten representative fruits was recorded ( **Fig. 2e**, **Supplementary Fig.
6** and **Supplementary Note** ) and genomic DNA was iso­ lated from fresh leaves using the CTAB method.
For bulked segregant analysis, bulk DNA samples for big- and small-fruit accessions were constructed by mixing equal amounts of DNA from 50 individuals showing extremely big and small fruits, respectively.
Roughly 20× genome sequences for each parent (TS-400 and TS-my) and 50× data for each bulk sample (big fruit and small fruit) were generated.
Short reads were aligned against the reference genome (release SL2.40) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)
[47], and SNPs were identi­ fied using SAMtools [48] .
SNPs between two parental genomes were identified for further analysis when the base quality value was ≥20 and the SNP quality value was ≥20.
On the basis of these criteria and the number of SNPs with read  depth from 4 to 200, a SNP index was calculated for both bulk samples express­ ing the proportion of reads harboring SNPs that were identical to those in the big-fruit parent (TS-400).
A ∆SNP index was obtained by subtracting the SNP index for the small-fruit bulk sample from that for the big-fruit bulk sample.
An average SNP index for the big-fruit and small-fruit bulk samples was cal­ culated using a 1,000-kb sliding window with a step size of 10 kb ( **Fig.
2f,g** ).
We also calculated the statistical confidence intervals of the ∆SNP index under  the null hypothesis of no QTLs.
For each position, the 95% confidence inter­ vals of the ∆SNP index were obtained following the method described in Takagi _et al._
[49] .
**Genome-wide association studies for fruit color.
**
We used 10,990,318 highquality SNPs (MAF > 0.05) to perform GWAS for fruit color in 231 accessions (205 red- and 26 pink-fruit accessions).
The association analyses were per­ formed using the compressed MLM [50,51] ( **Fig.
3b** ) with TASSEL 4.0 (ref. 52).
To further detect the causative variant in the significantly associated region (chromosome 1: 71,229,871–71,258,882), we analyzed the discordant pairedend reads between pink and red tomatoes by aligning the resequenced reads of 20 pink- and 20 red-fruit accessions against the reference genome (release SL2.40) using BWA and SAMtools.
We further checked the variants in 205 red- and 122 pink-fruit accessions from our tomato germplasm and IVF-CAAS accessions by direct PCR and Sanger sequencing.
**Detection of introgression status from wild germplasm in cultivars.
**
Some wild accessions harbor important loci, including disease resistance genes ( _R_ genes), and have been widely applied in modern tomato breeding programs.
To detect introgressions in modern cultivars, we analyzed the introgression pattern by calculating the ratio of identical SNPs between cultivated accessions (including 112 CER, 166 BIG and 17 F 1 accessions) and wild donor accessions ( **Fig.
4** ).
The ratio from each chromosome was plotted in a 100-kb sliding window with a step size of 10 kb.   39.
