In this** **study, we identified a 54-base pair** _**cis-**_ **regulatory region in** _**IPA1**_ **via a tiling-deletion-based CRISPR–Cas9 screen that, when** **deleted, resolves the tradeoff between grains per panicle and tiller number, leading to substantially enhanced grain yield per** **plant.
Mechanistic studies revealed that the deleted fragment is a target site for the transcription factor An-1 to repress** _**IPA1**_ **expression in panicles and roots.
Targeting gene regulatory regions should help dissect tradeoff effects and provide a rich** **source of targets for breeding complementary beneficial traits.
**    lant breeding is largely constrained by the tradeoffs among different agronomic traits, such as penalties of yield by plant # P immunity, dilution effect of plant nutrition and grain quality  by yield and negative correlations among plant architecture components [1][–][4] .
Some tradeoffs are caused by linkage drags, which could be solved by fine mapping and recombination of linked causal genes by conventional breeding [5][,][6] .
However, many of these tradeoffs are caused by gene pleiotropy.
In African cultivated rice ( _Oryza glaber-_ _rima_ Steud.), mutations in the domesticated gene _GL4_ prevented seed shattering but led to smaller seeds [7] .
In modern wheat varieties, the non-functional _NAM-B1_ allele increased grain yield but reduced the content of grain protein [8][,][9] .
In Asia rice cultivars, the ‘Green Revolution’ gene _semi-dwarf 1_ shortened plant height to reduce lodging risk but also reduced its biomass and nitrogen use-efficiency [10][–][12] .
Moreover, current gene studies usually focused on several target traits but ignored others [13] .
Owing to all of the above, only a small fraction of cloned genes and alleles has been successfully used in breeding.
Reducing the gene pleiotropy may facilitate plant breeding to overcome the tradeoff effects, but the development of effective strategies to achieve this goal has been very limited.
Rice is one of the most important staple foods, feeding half of the world’s population.
Rice yield is largely determined by three component traits: panicle number or effective tiller number, grain number per panicle or panicle size and grain weight or grain size
[14] .
However, these three traits are usually inversely related in rice [15][,][16] .
A general consideration is that they are compromised by the total energy limitation, and increasing them together seems to be an impossible mission. _IPA1_, encoding a SQUAMOSA promoter binding protein-like (SPL) transcription factor OsSPL14, is a master regulator of rice plant architecture, which controls multiple anatomical aspects [17][,][18] .
_
IPA1_ has been considered as a new ‘Green Revolution’ gene, as its natural gain-of-function alleles _ipa1-1D_ and _ipa1-2D_ with elevated _IPA1_
RNA levels can lead to substantially enlarged panicle, thickened culm, reduced ineffective tillers and enhanced disease    resistance, which have been broadly used in breeding new elite rice varieties [17][–][23] .
However, _IPA1_ alleles showed a tradeoff effect between panicle size and tiller number [21][,][24] .
IPI1 (IPA1 interacting protein 1), a RING-finger E3 ligase, can regulate the protein level of IPA1 in a tissue-specific manner, and its loss-of-function mutant could partially overcome the tradeoff effect of _IPA1_ (ref.
[25] ), but E3 ligases may have many targets and, thus, lead to other tradeoff effects.
The changes on _cis-_
regulatory regions (CRRs) can regulate quantitative traits at different levels
[26][–][30], and rice tiller number and panicle size are determined in separated tissues during different developmental stages [14] .
We, therefore, hypothesized that modifying _IPA1_ CRRs may provide a strategy to overcome the drag between tiller number and panicle size to outperform current elite natural alleles.
Here we describe a tiling-deletion-based screen for _IPA1_ CRRs by CRISPR–Cas9.
We found that these deletions can alter the expression levels of _IPA1_ in tissue-specific manners, which subsequently reduced the pleiotropic effect of _IPA1_ and generated a wide range of phenotype variations in tiller number and panicle size.
Among these, an allele harboring a 54-base pair (bp) deletion in the promoter can simultaneously increase panicle number and size, thus leading to enhanced grain yield.
We further found that this region could be bound by An-1 to repress _IPA1_ expression in panicle, which may lead to inhibited secondary and spikelet meristems.
This transgene-free _IPA1_ allele may, thus, improve rice yield, and the tiling-deletion screen approach may provide a practical way to reduce gene pleiotropy and tradeoff effects in plant breeding.
**Results** **Tiling deletions in** _**IPA1**_ **CRRs could overcome tradeoffs.
** We systematically dissected the CRRs of _IPA1_ by creating and investigating a series of genome-edited lines with deletions in the _IPA1_ promoter, untranslated regions (UTRs) and downstream region by CRISPR– Cas9 (Fig. 1a).
We used the certified variety Zhonghua 11 (ZH11) as the genetic background to fully explore the potential increase    1 State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Innovation Academy for Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.

in grain yield.
By transforming 39 vectors harboring 2–4 designed single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting adjacent sites on _IPA1_ CRRs (Extended Data Fig.
1 and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2), we generated and genotyped 792 T 0 lines, of which 151 T 0 lines containing deletions were harvested (Supplementary Table 3).
To exclude transgene interference, ten T 1 plants from each selected T 0 line were grown and genotyped, and 68 of 1,510 T 1 plants were identified both transgene-free and homozygous on edited sites.
Among them, 21 T 1 plants, including ten lines with deletions in the promoter, five in UTRs and six in downstream regions, were selected for further study (Fig. 1b).
The deletions in these 21 lines have an average 68-bp    length, covering from the 811-bp upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) to the 418-bp downstream of the transcription termination site (TTS).
These 21 lines were analyzed for effective tiller number, panicle weight and other agronomic traits for 2 years (Fig.
1b, Extended Data Fig.
2 and Supplementary Table 4).
The phenotypes of these lines showed high correlations between two generations, suggesting that their genetic backgrounds are stable (Extended Data Fig. 3).
Surprisingly, we found that all of these 21 lines have significant alterations on three or more traits compared to ZH11.

Moreover, the panicle weights of all lines showed a moderate linear correlation ( _R_
[2] = 0.65) with their _IPA1_ expression levels in young panicles (Fig. 1c), indicating that _IPA1_ expression levels in young panicles can partially determine panicle weight in a quantitative manner.
In contrast, we found that, whereas only the deletion of two regions could significantly change the expression levels of _IPA1_ in the shoot base, 11 lines showed significantly altered tiller numbers (Fig. 1b).
Consistent with this, the tiller numbers of all lines showed a weak correlation ( _R_
[2] = 0.23) with their _IPA1_ expression levels in the shoot base (Fig. 1d), possibly because the expression of _IPA1_ in other tissues may also affect tiller number.
The expression levels of _IPA1_ in shoot base and young panicle in these lines showed almost no correlation ( _R_
[2] = 0.06) (Fig.
1e), suggesting that the CRRs in different deleted regions may be responsible for regulating _IPA1_ expression in different tissues.
We, therefore, analyzed the correlations of different traits in these lines (Fig. 1f) and found that tiller number, grain number per panicle, plant height, grain setting rate, thousand-grain weight and stem diameter exhibited weak correlations to each other, suggesting that these traits could be separately controlled by these deletions.
**IPA1-Pro10 simultaneously increased tiller number and pani-** **cle size.
**
Among these lines, we found that one line, IPA1-Pro10, which harbored a 54-bp deletion in the _IPA1_ promoter (this 54-bp was designated as IPA1-Pro10 fragment), can simultaneously increase tiller number and panicle weight in 2 years (Fig.
1b and Supplementary Table 4).
We first confirmed that no mutation was found in predicted off-target sites (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Then, we in detail surveyed IPA1-Pro10 and compared it to wild-type ZH11; to _ipa1-5D_ (containing a gain-of-function _IPA1_ allele with two single-nucleotide substitutions on miR156/529 target sites in the ZH11 background); and to _ipa1-12_ (containing a loss-of-function _IPA1_ allele with a large deletion in the ZH11 background) (Fig.
2a and Supplementary Fig. 2).
As shown in Fig.
2b,c, IPA1-Pro10 has combined advantages of both _ipa1-5D_ and _ipa1-12_ .
In particular, the tiller number of IPA1-Pro10 was similar to _ipa1-12_, which was significantly higher than ZH11, and the grain number per panicle of IPA1-Pro10 was similar to _ipa1-5D_, which was significantly higher than ZH11.
The plant height, stem diameter, panicle weight and root diameter were also increased in IPA1-Pro10, whereas the grain setting rate and thousand-grain weight of IPA1-Pro10 showed no significant differences compared to ZH11 (Fig.
2d–i and Extended Data Fig. 4).
Consequently, the total yield of eight plants of IPA1-Pro10 was increased by 103% compared to ZH11, which was much higher than the 26% increase in _ipa1-5D_ (Fig. 2j).
We then in detail examined the expression patterns of _IPA1_ in IPA1-Pro10 plants.
We found that _IPA1_ expression levels in IPA1-Pro10 were significantly increased in panicles at different stages and root and decreased in shoot base and tiller bud compared to ZH11 (Extended Data Fig. 5).
To further confirm that IPA1-Pro10 has such high potential in increasing rice yield in paddy, we grew IPA1-Pro10 and ZH11 each in three 6.7-m [2] test plots (Fig. 2k).
Compared to ZH11, the tiller number per plant and grain number per panicle of IPA1-Pro10 were increased by 7.2% and 8.5%, respectively, and the yield was boosted by 15.9% with similar heading dates (Fig. 2l–n and Extended Data Fig. 6).
These results demonstrated that this transgene-free _IPA1_ allele ‘ _ipa1-pro10_ ’ with a 54-bp deletion in the promoter showed great potential in high-yield breeding in rice, even much higher than gain-of-function _IPA1_ alleles.
Moreover, we generated the homozygous and heterozygous IPA1-Pro10 plants (Fig. 3a) and surveyed agronomic traits.
The results showed that _ipa1-pro10_ was a semi-dominant allele in regulating plant height, tiller number, grains per panicle, stem diameter, panicle weight and root diameter, and the plants with the homozygous _ipa1-pro10_ allele had the highest yield per plant (Fig.
3b–j).

We searched for the possible transcription factor binding sites and found a potential binding motif ‘GCGCGTGT’ of An-1 in this region (Fig.
4a and Supplementary Table 5)
[31] .
_
An-1_ encodes a previously reported domestication-related basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, which positively regulated awn length and negatively regulated grain number per panicle
[32] .
The promoter sequences of _IPA1_ homologous genes varied considerably among different species, but we found multiple potential An-1 binding sites in the promoters of _IPA1_ homologous genes in tested species in the family Poaceae, including Tausch’s goatgrass, purple false brome, sorghum, corn and foxtail millet, but not in the dicots Arabidopsis and tobacco (Extended Data Fig. 7).
Compared to wild rice, rice cultivar GLA4 carried a transposon insertion in the promoter region of _An-1_, leading to eliminated expression of _An-1_ specifically at the apex of lemma and reduced awn length
[32] .
ZH11 contained a similar allele of _An-1_ as GLA4 with intact coding region (Supplementary Fig. 3).
_An-1_ was highly expressed in the root and panicle of ZH11 and IPA1-Pro10 (Extended Data Fig.
8), and ZH11-type An-1 was localized in the nucleus (Supplementary Fig. 4), suggesting that An-1 was a functional protein in ZH11.
We, therefore, tested whether An-1 could directly bind to the _IPA1_ promoter and regulate its expression.
We conducted the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using the biotin-labeled IPA1-Pro10 fragment as the probe and observed a shifted band when recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-An-1 protein    **Nature Biotechnology**

4b and Supplementary Fig. 5).
A super-shifted band was shown with the addition of anti-GST antibody, and the unlabeled cold probe could compete with the biotin-labeled probe.
No shifted band was observed with the mutated probe changing the An-1 binding motif to ‘AAAAAAAA’.
Furthermore, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)–qPCR assays in ZH11 and IPA1-Pro10 calli transformed with _ProUbiquitin:An-1-GFP_ using an anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody and qPCR primers that amplified a 98-bp region in the _IPA1_ promoter.
The results showed a significant enrichment of An-1 at the _IPA1_ promoter in ZH11 but not in IPA1-Pro10 calli (Fig.
4c and Supplementary Fig. 5), suggesting that An-1 could bind to the _IPA1_ promoter in ZH11 but not in IPA1-Pro10.
These in vitro and in vivo results showed that An-1 could bind to the IPA1-Pro10 fragment.
We then conducted an in vitro transcription regulation assay to dissect the regulation function of An-1 to the _IPA1_ promoter.
We found that, in both tobacco leaf and rice protoplast systems, the luciferase reporters driven by the IPA1-Pro10 fragment or the wild-type 2.5-kilobase (kb) promoter of _IPA1_ were each significantly inhibited by the An-1 protein (Fig.
4d,e).
In contrast, the luciferase reporters driven by the 2.5-kb promoter of _IPA1_ with a 54-bp deletion were not inhibited by the An-1 protein in both systems.
Furthermore, we generated _An-1_ loss-of-function and overexpression calli in ZH11 and IPA1-Pro10 backgrounds and found that the loss of function and overexpression of _An-1_ led to the increased and decreased _IPA1_ expression, respectively, only in the calli with ZH11, but not IPA1-Pro10, backgrounds (Fig.
4f,g and Supplementary Fig. 6).
Taken together, these results demonstrated that An-1 could directly bind to the IPA1-Pro10 fragment in the _IPA1_ promoter to repress its expression.
**Deletion of An-1 binding site-containing fragment was respon-** **sible for IPA1-Pro10 panicle and root phenotypes.
**
To further elucidate whether An-1 binding site was critical for overcoming the tradeoff effects of _IPA1_, we generated three edited lines with deletions in this region.
IPA1-Pro11 harbored 86-bp deletion at −197 to −112 upstream of the TSS of _IPA1_, which contained 14-bp overlap with the IPA1-Pro10 fragment (−125 to −72) covering 8-bp An-1 binding site (−124 to −117).
IPA1-Pro12 harbored a 64-bp deletion (−176 to  − 113) with 13-bp overlap with the IPA1-Pro10 fragment covering the An-1 binding site.
Coincidentally, we obtained one line IPA1-Pro13 that harbored two deletions (−175 to −126 and −116 to −109) in the flanking regions of An-1 binding site and retained an 11-bp fragment containing the An-1 binding site (Fig. 5a).
We found that the deletions of IPA1-Pro11 and IPA1-Pro12 fragments led to the effects similar to that of IPA1-Pro10 in increasing plant height, grains per panicle, stem diameter and root diameter in a semi-dominant manner but had no effect in regulating tiller number (Fig.
5b–n).
Therefore, IPA1-Pro11 and IPA1-Pro12 plants exhibited increased grain yield per plant (Fig.
5h,o), but the fold of increase was lower than IPA1-Pro10 plants (Fig. 3j), the tiller number of which was also increased (Fig. 3c).
The IPA1-Pro10 fragment may contain other regulatory _cis_ -elements in regulating tiller number.
Moreover, IPA1-Pro13 plants showed no significant differences in any of these traits compared to ZH11 (Fig.
5p–v).
Taken together, all these results demonstrated that the An-1 binding site-containing fragment in the _IPA1_ promoter was responsible for regulating multiple traits in panicle, stem and root.
**Diverse transcriptional regulation of** _**IPA1**_ **in determining dif-
** **ferent traits.
** Near-isogenic line (NIL) _
NIL-an-1_ is an awnless _indica_ variety NA93-11 carrying a loss-of-function _An-1_ allele with a frameshift mutation, and _NIL-An-1_ is an introgression line of NA93-11 containing a functional _An-1_ allele from an accession of common wild rice (W2014, _Oryza rufipogon_ )
[33] (Supplementary Fig. 3).
We examined the panicle, shoot and root phenotypes in two NILs of _An-1_ .
We found that NIL- _an-1_ had significantly increased grain number per panicle, plant height, stem diameter and root thickness than NIL- _An-1_ (Fig. 6a–e) but with no significant changes in tiller number (Fig. 6f).
All these phenotypic changes were similar to that of IPA1-Pro11 and IPA1-Pro12 plants compared to ZH11 (Fig.
5b–o).
We, therefore, examined the expression levels of _IPA1_ in two NILs of _An-1_ and found that _IPA1_ expression levels were significantly increased in the panicle and root of NIL- _an-1_ compared to NIL- _An-1_ (Fig.
6g,h)
but with no significant differences in shoot base and tiller bud (Fig.
6i and Extended Data Fig. 9), which were all consistent with the phenotypic changes.
These results suggested that the regulation of An-1 to _IPA1_ was tissue-specific.
Detailed analysis of panicles between _An-1_ NILs revealed that the grain number per primary branch (GNPPB) and secondary branch number per primary branch (SBNPPB) were significantly increased in NIL- _an-1_, whereas the primary branch number (PBN) had no significant changes (Fig.
6j–n).
We then examined the panicle traits of the IPA1-Pro10.
Similarly to the effect of loss-of-function _an-1_ in NIL- _an-1_, we found that GNPPB and SBNPPB of IPA1-Pro10 were all significantly increased compared to ZH11, but the PBN had no significant changes (Fig.
6o–s).
Similarly, IPA1-Pro11 and IPA1-Pro12 showed increased GNPPB and SBNPPB, whereas IPA1-Pro13 had no significant changes (Extended Data Fig. 10).
Different from IPA1-Pro10, _ipa1-5D_ had significantly increased PBN and total secondary branch number (SBN), unchanged SBNPPB and reduced GNPPB (Fig.
6o–s), consistent with a previous report
[17] .
All these data suggest that An-1
and miR156/529 may have separate roles in regulating _IPA1_ expression levels in panicle, possibly because they have different expression patterns during panicle development
[32] .
Taken together, all these data suggest that _IPA1_ is diversely regulated by multiple _cis_ -elements and microRNAs in different tissues and developmental stages, which, in turn, determine different aspects of plant architecture.
**Discussion**
In summary, we deployed a tiling-deletion screening approach on _IPA1_ regulatory regions to systematically analyze their phenotypic variations.
We identified one line, IPA1-Pro10, containing a 54-bp deletion in the promoter that can simultaneously increase tillering number and panicle size to greatly enhance grain yield beyond current elite _IPA1_ alleles through overcoming their tradeoff.
In mechanism, we found that transcription factor An-1 can directly bind to the GCGCGTGT motif on the IPA1-Pro10 fragment to repress _IPA1_ expression in the panicle and may specifically inhibit spikelet and secondary meristems of the panicle.
The transgene-free deletion of this region modulated tissue-specific expression alterations and separated the pleiotropy of both _IPA1_ and _An-1_ to overcome agronomic tradeoffs.
Although the regulatory mechanism of the IPA1-Pro10 fragment on tiller number remains to be studied in the future, this allele provides a valuable genetic resource in breeding    **Fig.

superior-yield rice, and the strategy used in this study could be applied to overcome gene pleiotropy and tradeoffs in different crops.
Tradeoffs among agronomic traits limited the crop yield.
Some tradeoffs are caused by linkage drag.
One example is the linkage of low grain quality and high yield in rice, that the chalkiness regulating gene _Chalk5_ is closely located to two QTLs for grain width and weight
[5] .
After cloning these genes, conventional breeding could overcome this tradeoff by hybridization and marker-assisted selection to create rice varieties with both good quality and high yield.
However, most of the other tradeoffs are caused by gene pleiotropy, which could be overcome by the mutation in the CRRs.
However, the limited number of genetic variations in CRRs is the main obstacle in crop breeding.
The gene pleiotropy can be caused by multiple biological functions of the same protein, such as the carboxylation and oxygenation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate by RuBisCO; meanwhile, some other gene pleiotropy is caused by different spatial-temporal    functions of the same gene.
In this study, we showed that the tiling-deletion screen for CRRs could be used to reduce the gene pleiotropy in the latter cases, which is promising to tackle the breeding difficulty in overcoming tradeoffs.
Previous studies on An-1 focused mainly on the panicle morphologies
[32] .
Moreover, although the expression of _An-1_ could be detected in various tissues (Extended Data Fig.
8), the expression levels of _IPA1_ in NIL- _an-1_ were significantly higher than NIL- _An-1_ in the panicle and root but showed no significant differences in the tiller bud and shoot base (Fig.
6g–i and Extended Data Fig. 9), suggesting that An-1 could regulate _IPA1_ expression in a tissue-specific manner.
The deletions in IPA1-Pro10, IPA1-Pro11 and IPA1-Pro12 lines all covered the An-1 binding site in the _IPA1_ promoter, but only IPA1-Pro10 had a significant increase in tiller number (Figs.

Articles    that _An-1_ was also a pleiotropic gene constrained by the tradeoff between tiller number and grain size, whereas NIL- _an-1_ had significantly reduced tiller number compared to NIL- _An-1_ (Fig.
6f,j–n).
Deletion of the IPA1-Pro10 fragment may reduce the pleiotropic effects of both _IPA1_ and _An-1_ .
Many genetic variations in CRRs were found to be critical for domestication, suggesting that the changes in _cis-
_
regulatory elements may play a key role in accelerating crop breeding [27][,][34][–][37] .
However, the research methods on _cis-_ regulatory elements are still very limited [38][–][40] .
Large-scale modification of CRRs of crops has been used for optimizing specific traits or uncovering gene functions [27][,][28] .
In this study, we used the tiling-deletion screen of CRRs to overcome tradeoffs for enhancing crop yield and found that all 21 lines with deletions in CRRs can cause phenotypical variations, indicating that their regulation mechanisms are very complex.
We focused on one deleted region causing extraordinary performance in grain yield and identified the transcriptional regulation mechanism between _An-1_ and _IPA1_ that specifically controlled the GNPPB.
Systematic studies on the CRRs of key agronomic genes will uncover more important transcriptional regulatory networks, thus providing key information in guiding the creation of novel elite alleles in plant breeding.

** Rice ( _Oryza sativa_ L.) ssp.
_japonica_ Zhonghua11 (ZH11), CRISPR–Cas9 edited lines, NIL- _An-1_ and NIL- _an-1_ were grown in the experimental fields of the Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in Beijing and Hainan, China, from 2018 to 2021.
**Tiling-deletion screen.
**
We designed 39 sgRNAs with high specificity targeting the non-coding regions of _IPA1_ using CRISPRdirect
[41], including 28 sgRNAs targeting the promoter and 5′ UTR region and 11 sgRNAs targeting the region downstream of the stop codon (Supplementary Table 1).
We constructed 39 vectors, each of which contained two or four sgRNAs through cloning the sgRNAs into the binary vector pVK005-1 (ViewSolid Biotech, VK005-1) carrying _Cas9_ gene and sgRNA expression module for editing, as previously described [42][,][43] .
Then, the vectors were separately transformed into the _Agrobacterium tumefaciens_ strain EHA105
(ref.
[43] ).
The _Agrobacterium_ strains were mixed with equal amounts and used to transform the ZH11 callus.
Five pairs of primers were designed for sequencing the genome edits.
From the genotyping result of 792 T 0 plants, we selected 151 lines carrying deletions ≥5 bp, in which 132 lines contained deletions from 5 bp to 100 bp.
Ten T 1 plants for each of 151 selected T 0 lines were grown and genotyped for transgene using _hpt_ (hygromycin B phosphotransferase) gene as a marker and genomic editing on _IPA1_ .
Sixty-eight plants were identified both transgene-free and homozygous on edited sites.
Among these plants, 21 T 1 lines with deletion evenly covering the CRRs were selected for further analysis.
Twenty-four plants for each of these 21 lines were grown, and eight plants of these were randomly selected for phenotyping.
The CRISPR–Cas9 target sites, information of constructed vectors and editing information of 792 T 0 plants are shown in Supplementary Fig.
1 and Supplementary Tables 1–3.
**Generation of IPA1-Pro11, IPA1-Pro12 and IPA1-Pro13 lines.
**
We used the same construct that was used for the generation of IPA1-Pro10 to transform ZH11 rice calli, which contained TS15 and TS26 sgRNAs to generate new lines deleting the An-1 binding site.
The generated T 0 lines were genotyped by sequencing the PCR product that amplified using the IPA1-Pro-F4 and IPA1-Pro-R4 primers.
The IPA1-Pro11, IPA1-Pro12 and IPA1-Pro13 lines were identified, and the progeny of these lines were used for the phenotypic evaluation.
The information of the constructs, the sgRNAs and the primers used in the generation of these lines are shown in Supplementary Fig.
1 and Supplementary Tables 1, 2 and 6.
**Phenotypic evaluation.
**
We grew 24 plants of each edited line in three rows, with eight plants per row, in the experimental field in the summer of 2019 and 2020 in Beijing, and we randomly selected eight plants for the phenotyping of 21 edited lines.
The yield per plant, effective tiller number, panicle weight, plant height, primary branch number of panicle, secondary branch number of panicle, grain number per panicle, grain setting rate, thousand-grain weight and stem diameter were phenotyped for T 2 plants of 21 lines in Beijing in 2019, and tiller number and panicle weight of T 3 plants of 21 lines were phenotyped in Beijing in 2020.
The data from 2019 are shown in Supplementary Table 4, and the data from 2020 are shown in Fig.
1b.
For the lines with deletions including or around the An-1 binding site in the IPA1-Pro10 fragment, we grew six rows, eight plants per row, in total 48 plants of each homozygous, heterozygous and wild-type plant in the experimental field in the summer of 2021 in Beijing, and we randomly phenotyped 15 plants for each type.
The root diameter indicated the diameter of the basal part of the crown root after heading.
The stem diameter indicated the diameter of the third upper internode after heading.
**Prediction of transcription factor binding site.
**
The transcription factor binding sites on the promoters of rice _IPA1_ and its homologous genes in other species were predicted using PlantPAN 3.0, following the authors’ instructions [31] .
Predicted transcription factor binding sites are listed in Supplementary Table 5 and Extended Data Fig.
7.
**Electrophoretic mobility shift assay.
**
The _An-1_ coding sequence was PCR amplified and introduced into pGEX-4T-1 between BamHI and XhoI sites.
Proteins GST and GST-An-1 were expressed in BL21 Transetta cells (TransGen, CD801-01), respectively, and purified with glutathione-conjugated Sepharose 4 fast flow (GE Healthcare, 17-5132-01).
Biotin-labeled DNA probes (Supplementary Table 6) were synthesized by Thermo Fisher Scientific.
The assay was conducted using anti-GST antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, G1160) at 1:40 dilution and LightShift EMSA Optimization and Control Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 20148X), following the manufacturer’s instructions as described previously [24] .
Images were taken using a charge-coupled device camera.
Experiments were repeated independently three times.
**ChIP–qPCR assay.
**
The ChIP–qPCR using the _ProUbiquitin:An-1-GFP_ transgenic calli was performed using anti-GFP antibody (Abcam, ab290) at 2 μg per ChIP reaction, according to the method described previously [20][,][44] .
PCR reactions were performed in triplicate for each sample.
The fold enrichment was calculated against the _Ubiquitin_ promoter.
No addition of antibodies (NoAbs) was served as a control.
Experiments were repeated independently three times.
Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 6.
**RNA extraction and quantitative PCR.
** Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15596026), following the manufacturer’s instructions.
The leaves, roots, shoot bases and tiller buds from 2-week-old seedlings, leaves and stems from rice after heading stage and 1-cm young panicles or young panicles in different stages were sampled for examining the _IPA1_ and _An-1_ expression levels.
Panicle length and _An-1_ expression levels were used as development stage control of young panicles.
The genomic DNA removal and first-strand cDNA synthesis were conducted using ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Master Mix with gDNA Remover (Toyobo, FSQ-301).
Primer sequences used for quantitative PCR are listed in Supplementary Table 6. _
Actin1_ (LOC_Os03g50885) was used as an internal control gene.
Quantitative PCR was performed using the CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) with CFX manager software using SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad, 172-5201).
Experiments were repeated independently three times.
**Rice protoplast transfection.
**
The transfection of rice protoplast was conducted as previously described [24] .
The shoots of 10-day-old rice seedlings were cut into 0.5-mm pieces and soaked in 0.6 M mannitol.
The tissues were in enzyme solution at 28 °C for 3 hours with gentle shaking.
The protoplasts were washed two times with W5 solution and resuspended in MMG solution.
Plasmids were added to protoplasts and mixed with PEG solution for 10 minutes at room temperature.
The protoplasts were washed two times with W5 solution and resuspended in W5 solution.
The protoplasts were incubated overnight at 28 °C in the dark.
**Subcellular localization of An-1.
**
The coding sequence of ZH11 An-1 was ligated to pCAMBIA1300 35S-MCS-GFP between BamHI and KpnI sites.
The plasmid was purified and transfected into rice protoplast as above.
The subcellular protein localization was observed using an Olympus Fluoview FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope with FV10-ASW software.
Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 6.
**Transcriptional activity assay in tobacco leaf and rice protoplast.
**
To generate the _ProIPA1-Pro10 fragment:LUC_, the 54-bp deletion in IPA1-Pro10 was synthesized and ligated upstream of minimal 35S promoter of pGreenII 0800-LUC vector [45][,][46] .
To generate the _ProIPA1:LUC_ and _ProIPA1-Pro10:LUC_, the 2.5-kb promoter regions upstream of ATG of _IPA1_ in wild-type ZH11 and IPA1-Pro10 were PCR amplified and ligated directly upstream of _LUC_ gene of pGreenII 0800-LUC vector, respectively.
The plasmids were transformed to _Agrobacterium_ _tumefaciens_ strain EHA105
harboring pSOUP helper plasmid.
_
Agrobacterium_ strain harboring pBI221- _P19_ was mixed with other _
Agrobacterium_ strains in a 1:9 ratio to suppress RNA silencing.

### Reporting Summary   Nature Research wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish.
This form provides structure for consistency and transparency in reporting.
For further information on Nature Research policies, see our Editorial Policies and the Editorial Policy Checklist.
###### Statistics   For all statistical analyses, confirm that the following items are present in the figure legend, table legend, main text, or Methods section.
n/a Confirmed   The exact sample size ( _n_ ) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement   A statement on whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly   The statistical test(s) used AND whether they are one- or two-sided _
Only common tests should be described solely by name; describe more complex techniques in the Methods section.
_
A description of all covariates tested   A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisons   A full description of the statistical parameters including central tendency (e.g. means) or other basic estimates (e.g. regression coefficient) AND variation (e.g. standard deviation) or associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g. confidence intervals)   For null hypothesis testing, the test statistic (e.g. _F_, _t_, _r_ ) with confidence intervals, effect sizes, degrees of freedom and _P_ value noted  _Give P values as exact values whenever suitable._
For Bayesian analysis, information on the choice of priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings   For hierarchical and complex designs, identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomes   Estimates of effect sizes (e.g. Cohen's _d_, Pearson's _r_ ), indicating how they were calculated   _
Our web collection on_ _statistics for biologists contains articles on many of the points above.
