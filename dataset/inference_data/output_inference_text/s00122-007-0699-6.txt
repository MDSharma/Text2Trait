The study of phenotypic and genetic diversity in landrace collections is important for germplasm conservation.
In addition, the characterisation of very diversiWed materials with molecular markers oVers a unique opportunity to deWne signiWcant marker-trait associations of biological and agronomic interest.
Here, 50 tomato landraces (mainly collected in central Italy), nine vintage and modern cultivars, and two wild outgroups were grown at two locations in central Italy and characterised for 15 morpho-physiological traits and 29 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci.
The markers were selected to include a group of loci in regions harbouring reported quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that aVect fruit size and/or shape (Q-SSRs) and a group of markers that have not been mapped or shown to have a priori known linkage (NQ-SSRs).
As revealed by univariate and multivariate analyses of morphological data, the landraces grouped according to vegetative and reproductive   Communicated by I. L. Goldman.

Compared to the low molecular polymorphism reported in tomato modern cultivars, our data reveal a high level of molecular diversity in landraces.
Such diversity has allowed the inference of the existence of a genetic structure that was factored into the association analysis.
As the proportion of signiWcant associations is higher between the Q-SSR subset of markers and the subset of traits related to fruit size and shape than for all of the other combinations, we conclude that this approach is valid for establishing truepositive marker-trait relationships in tomato.
**Introduction**   Understanding the molecular genetic control of phenotypic variation is a major task in the study of natural and cultivated plant populations.
This challenging objective becomes much more complicated when traits controlled by quantitative loci are considered, as for most of the features underlying crop yield and quality.
Along with the classical analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) through the genotyping of suitable segregating populations, new approaches have recently been proposed, where the identiWcation of QTLs for important traits is addressed through association genetics after the phenotypic and genotypic characterization of collections of diverse materials (Lynch and Walsh 1997; Flint-Garcia et al. 2005).
Since its Wrst application on inbred maize lines (Thornsberry et al. 2001), association mapping has proven to be a reliable tool to highlight marker-trait associations in a number of plant species (Kraakman et al. 2001; Zhang et al. 2005; Aranzana et al. 2005; Breseghello and Sorrels 2006; Herrmann et al. 2006).
Among the vegetables, the tomato ( _Solanum lycopersi-_ _cum_ L.) has been the species of choice for the study of the  ## 123   658 Theor Appl Genet (2008) 116:657–669    genetic control of quantitative variation, especially for those traits determining fruit size, shape and quality (Paterson et al. 1991; Eshed and Zamir 1995; Grandillo et al. 1996, 1999; Frary et al. 2000; Van der Knaap and Tanksley 2001, 2003; Fulton et al. 2002; Van der Knaap et al. 2002; Barrero and Tanksley 2004; Causse et al. 2004).
The importance of tomato as a crop, as well as the reason for its wide adoption in QTL studies can be seen from its history, which shows that the large variability that exists is due to a limited number of “domestication” genes, that mainly control fruit dimensional, structural, aesthetic and quality attributes (Grandillo et al. 1999; Tanksley 2004).
First introduced into Europe from Central and Southern America at the beginning of the sixteenth century, the tomato was initially considered a botanical curiosity, and its potential as a foodstuV was hindered by the suspicion of the presence of alkaloids in the fruit.
It was only in the seventeenth century that the species began to be appreciated as an edible product and that its cultivation rapidly diVused through the Old World.
This introduction represented a bottleneck, narrowing the genetic diversity of the cultivated tomato germplasm (Rick 1976).
In Europe, the tomato found success mainly in the Mediterranean countries, including Spain and Italy (Soressi 1969; Esquinas-Alcazar and Nuez 1995; García-Martínez et al. 2006), from where the species was reintroduced into North America in the eighteenth century (Rick 1976).
Due to its success in cultivation, in North America, Italy and Spain, _S. lycopersicum_ found a secondary centre for diversiWcation (Bailey et al. 1960; García-Martínez et al. 2006).
However, in North America, the standard tomato soon became the nearly globular, solid and smooth fruit; the other forms of tomatoes were grown for curiosity as “heirlooms” or “garden” varieties (Bailey et al. 1960; Noble 1994).
In contrast, in Italy and in other European countries, the Xat angled and ribbed tomatoes, and the pear-shaped, heart-shaped, extremely elongated, and cherry and plum forms were appreciated and cultivated.
All these types Wnally gave rise to landraces that have been adopted for centuries and are still common in the local markets (Soressi 1969;
Ruiz et al. 2005).
The initial narrow genetic basis of the tomato was further restricted by the development of vintage and modern cultivars, when much of the diversity within the cultivated _S. lycopersicum_ was lost (Rick 1976;
Miller and Tanksley 1990; Williams and St. Clair 1993).
For this reason, since molecular analyses have become available for the estimation of genetic diversity, the level of intraspeciWc polymorphism reported in the cultivated tomato gene pool has generally been very low compared to that revealed in other self-compatible, autogamous species (Miller and Tanksley 1990;
Williams and St. Clair 1993 and refs therein; Broun and Tanksley 1996; Noli et al. 1999; Archak et al. 2002;  ## 123    García-Gusano et al. 2004).
Relatively to other classes of molecular markers (Miller and Tanksley 1990;
Williams and St. Clair 1993;
Noli et al. 1999; Archak et al. 2002; Park et al. 2004; Frary et al. 2005; Tam et al. 2005), simple sequence repeats (SSRs) have shown higher level of intraspeciWc polymorphism in cultivated _S. lycopersicum_ (Bredemeijer et al. 2002; Suliman-Pollatschek et al. 2002;
He et al. 2003; Tam et al. 2005; García-Martínez et al. 2006).
In addition, because these markers also oVered the advantage of genetic co-dominance, high reproducibility, easy detection, and multiallelic variation, SSRs were widely developed for genetic studies in tomato (Smulders et al. 1997; Areshchenkova 2000; He et al. 2003; Frary [et al. 2005;
Tam et al. 2005; http://www.sgn.cornell.edu/).](http://dx.doi.org/http://www.sgn.cornell.edu/)
As association analysis has not been implemented in tomato to date, the present study aimed to address this procedure by using markers and plant materials that provide the best probability of high intraspeciWc variation.
Therefore, through morphological descriptors and SSR markers  we characterised a collection of Italian tomato landraces  and suitable control genotypes.
Both morphological and molecular data were used to infer the existence of a genetic structure in the collection studied.
To gain a direct validation of the reliability of the associations revealed, a portion of the markers was selected as located in proximity to known QTLs that control tomato fruit size and shape.
**Materials and methods**   Plant material   Morphological and molecular genetic diversity was assessed in 61 accessions of cultivated tomato ( _Solanum_ _lycopersicum_ L.) or wild-related species.
The collection included 40 landraces (36 from central and southern Italy, and four from Latin America), ten accessions of commercially available landraces, nine vintage or modern cultivars, and one accession each of _S. lycopersicum_ var.
_cerasiforme_ and of _S. pimpinellifolium_ as wild outgroups.
Details on accession category, name, fruit-shape typology, acronym and origin are given in Supplementary Table S1.
Seed stocks of the cultivars, the wild species and the four acces sions from Latin America were obtained from either seed  markets or from the C.M. Rick Tomato Genetics Resource  Center (TGRC), University of California, Davis, USA (Supplementary Table S1).
The Italian landraces were either gathered from the farmers or from the local seed markets.
To brieXy explain the acronyms used, the Wrst two letters refer to the category (IL, Italian landrace; AL, Latin America landrace; CV, cultivar; WS, wild species).
For ALs, CVs, and WSs, the category is followed by the Wve letters of the accession name.
For ILs, the Wrst letter after   Theor Appl Genet (2008) 116:657–669 659    the category indicates the geographical region of provenance (A, Abruzzo; L, Lazio; M, Marche; S, South Italy; T, Tuscany; U, Umbria) or the commercial origin (C).
The two letters that follow indicate the fruit typology declared at the time of collection (FR, Xattened-ribbed; PE, pearshaped; HE, heart-shaped; EL, elongated; SM, small round or oval; OT, others).
Finally, the last two numbers refer to  the local code.
The original accessions were regrown to evaluate the presence of morphologically heterogeneous stocks.
Eight out of 59 accessions of cultivated tomato give rise to heterogeneous progeny.
In uniform accessions, a single healthy plant was selected and used for seed production and DNA extraction; in the heterogeneous ones, the material was obtained from a single plant selected as belonging to the modal class.
A Weld trial was established with the above described seed stocks at two locations in central Italy: Viterbo (42° 26�N, 12° 04�E) and Perugia (43° 05�N, 12° 05�E), in the same growing season (2004).
The accessions were arranged in a randomised block design with two replicates and four plants per elementary experimental unit.
Plants were grown in open Welds with standard agronomic practices.
Phenotypic data   On a single plant basis, 22 morpho-physiological traits were scored or calculated as detailed in Supplementary Table S2.
BrieXy, the traits recorded were growth habit (GH, score), plant height (PH, cm), Xowering date (FD, days), inXorescence type (IT, score), number of Xowers per inXorescence (NF), stigma exertion (SE, score), green shoulder (GS, score), ripening date (RD, days), fruit colour (FC, score), number of harvested fruits (NHF), weight of harvested fruits (WHF, g), fruit polar (PD, mm) and equatorial (ED, mm) diameters, stem-end shape (SES, score), blossom-end shape (BES, score), number of fruit locules (LN), pericarp thickness (PT, mm), and puViness (PUF, score).
The calculated variables were fruit-shape index [FS, (PD/PE)], mean fruit weight [FW, (WHF/NHF), g], Xowering-ripening interval [RT, (RD-FD), days] and pericarpthickness index
[PI, (PT/((PD + PE)/2))].
These descriptors largely conform to the guidelines of the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI; [http://www.](http://dx.doi.org/http://www.ipgri.cgiar.org/publications/pdf/286.pdf)
[ipgri.cgiar.org/publications/pdf/286.pdf).
Those variables](http://dx.doi.org/http://www.ipgri.cgiar.org/publications/pdf/286.pdf) used to calculate other variables (i.e. FD, RD, NHF, WHF, PD, ED, and PT) were excluded from the further analyses.
Among the genotypes, the two wild species were also excluded from the analysis of morphological data.
For the remaining 15 variables and 59 genotypes, diVerences and interactions were estimated through an analysis of variance adopting the General Linear Model (GLM) with the adjustments for experiments combined over more locations    (McIntosh 1983).
The Spearman rank correlation coeY cients between variables were calculated on the basis of the  mean values of the two environments.
All univariate analyses were carried out with the Statistical Analysis System software (SAS Institute Inc. 2002).
Correlation coeYcients were displayed graphically after multidimensional scaling [performed with the PERMAP 11.3 software (http://](http://dx.doi.org/http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~rbh8900/permap.html)
[www.ucs.louisiana.edu/»rbh8900/permap.html).](http://dx.doi.org/http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~rbh8900/permap.html)
Although all of the variables, with the exception of NF and PI, showed signiWcant genotype £ environment interactions, the examination of the data revealed that this signiWcance was due to the behaviour of a few genotypes for each trait.
Therefore, allowance was made for these interac tions and, after standardisation, the arithmetic means over locations were used to perform multivariate analyses in order to delineate clusters of morphologically similar individuals.
Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were carried out with the SYNTAX Package 5.0 (Podani 1993).
Clustering was based on the chord distance coeYcient (Orloci 1972) and the average linkage method was used as fusion criterion.
Genotypic data   The DNA extracted from each genotype selected for seed harvest was analysed with 29 SSR markers that were selected from the literature to obtain an approximate coverage of the tomato genome (at least two markers per chromosome).
BrieXy, the loci scored were LE21085, LEMDDNa, LELEUZIP, LELE25, LE20592, LEACS4A, LESSRPSPGb (Smulders et al. 1997), TMS63, TMS58, TMS54, EST258529, EST253712, TMS60, TMS59, TMS42, TMS52, EST245053 (Areshchenkova and Ganal 2002), Tom178-179, Tom59-60, Tom300-301, Tom67-68, Tom8-9, Tom41-42, Tom198-199, Tom162-163, Tom11 28, Tom47-48, Tom292-293, and Tom236-237 (SulimanPollatschek et al _._ 2002).
Details on the marker dataset are given in Table 1 and in Supplementary Table S3.
The SSRs were selected to include a group of markers located in regions harbouring reported QTLs that aVect fruit size and/ or shape (Q-SSRs, according to the criteria detailed below) and a group of markers either not mapped or having no a priori known linkage with genes aVecting fruit traits (NQSSRs).
Out of the 29 analysed loci, 16 were Q-SSRs and 13 NQ-SSRs.
To establish linkage relationships, marker (Areshchenkova and Ganal 2002; Suliman-Pollatschek et al. 2002) and QTL (Paterson et al. 1991; Grandillo et al. 1999; Van der Knaap and Tanksley 2001, 2003; Van der Knaap et al. 2002) positions were obtained from the literature.
Because the marker and/or QTL positions were reported frequently as conWdence intervals Xanked by markers, the position was approximated to the mid point of such bin.
Q-SSRs were thus deWned as markers having an  ## 123   660 Theor Appl Genet (2008) 116:657–669   **Table 1** Characteristics of the polymorphic SSR markers used    No. of alleles (present study) Allele size range All _

For the QTLs reviewed by](http://dx.doi.org/http://www.sgn.cornell.edu/cview/) Grandillo et al. (1999), only those showing a percent of phenotypic variance explained by the locus greater than 20% in at least one study were taken into account.
All of the QTLs reported by Van der Knaap and Tanksley (2003) were included as very frequently the QTLs that control traits not directly describing fruit size or shape were colocalized with QTLs responsible for fruit dimension.
DNA was obtained from young leaves by the miniextraction method of Doyle and Doyle (1987).
PCR ampliWcation was performed in a 20 �l total volume, containing 20 ng of genomic DNA template, 50 pmol of each of the two primers, 200 �M dNTPs, 2 mM MgCl 2, 1£ Taq polymerase buVer, and 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (Promega,  ## 123    Madison, WI, USA).
One of the two SSR primers was endlabelled with Cy5.
The ampliWcations were conducted with a Perkin-Elmer 9700 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), with an initial 5 min at 94°C that was followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at X°C, and 30 s at 72°C, plus 15 min Wnal extension at 72°C.
X°C refers to the annealing temperature, which is speciWed for each primer in the relevant reference (see Table 1 and Supplementary Table S3).
The ampliWcation products were separated on 6% (w/v) denaturing polyacrilamide (1:19 bis:acrilamide) gels and visualised with the GenomyxSC system (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA, USA).
Each individual was genotyped at each locus by scoring the length of the ampliWed SSR band with reference to molecular ladders and genotypes of known allelic composition.
Nine loci were monomorphic among the _S. lycopersicum_   Theor Appl Genet (2008) 116:657–669 661    genotypes (Supplementary Table S3) and were excluded from the subsequent analyses.
For polymorphic loci, the mean number of observed (No) and expected (Ne) alleles per locus, the observed (Ho) and expected (He) unbiased heterozygosity, and the percentage of polymorphic loci were calculated, considering both the whole collection and the subsets of genotypes based on germplasm category or fruit type.
The analysis was carried out with POWERMARKER Ver. 3.23
(Liu and Muse 2005; [http://](http://dx.doi.org/http://www.powermarker.net) [www.powermarker.net).
Genetic distance (Nei et al. 1983)](http://dx.doi.org/http://www.powermarker.net) matrices and cluster analyses based on the unweighted pair group method (UPGM) of Sneath and Sokal (1973) were calculated with the TREECON Ver.
1.3b software (Van de Peer and De Wachter 1993) using the 20 informative loci together or the subsets of the Q-SSRs and NQ-SSRs.
The morphology-based distance matrix was compared with those obtained from the molecular data using the 20 informative loci together or the subsets of Q-SSRs and NQSSRs by POWERMARKER, using Mantel’s test.
Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis was performed for the 20 polymorphic SSRs, with the dedicated procedure of [the TASSEL software, using 1,000 permutations (http://](http://dx.doi.org/http://www.maizegenetics.net/)
[www.maizegenetics.net/).](http://dx.doi.org/http://www.maizegenetics.net/)   To delineate clusters of individuals on the basis of their  genotypes at multiple loci the model-based STRUCTURE Ver. 2 software (Pritchard et al. 2000) was used, adopting the “admixture model”, a burn-in period of 30,000 iterations, and the data from 20 polymorphic SSR loci.
The number of clusters ( _k_ ) was set to Wve, as this number maximized the � _k_ parameter (Evanno et al. 2005).
This modelbased approach assumes unlinked loci and HW equilibrium.
In our case, the Wrst assumption is likely to be correct (even if some loci were of unknown map position and thus potentially linked to other SSR loci), but the HW would be violated.
However, because we used this approach only for classiWcation purposes, both aspects were not considered as providing bias towards our inferences.
Two analytical approaches were used to identify and validate putative marker-trait associations.
First, the non-para metric Kruskal–Wallis _K_ -test was chosen to take into  consideration the nature of most of the data variables that  signiWcantly departed from the assumption of normality.
This method can be regarded as the non-parametric equivalent of the one-way analysis of variance (Lehmann and D’Abrera 1975).
The second approach employed was the logistic regression procedure, a parametric test that factors into the analysis the existing population structure (FlintGarcia et al. 2005).
For the non-parametric analysis, morphological data were categorized into Wve classes, as described previously (Mazzucato 1995), using the mean and _�_ values (1, lower values; 5, higher values).
Associations were then detected according to the _K_ -test (NPAR1WAY SAS procedure, option WILCOXON, SAS    Institute Inc. 2002).
The parametric test was carried out using the logistic regression procedure of the TASSEL software, which estimates associations between segregating sites and phenotypes, while accounting for population structure.
The genotypic data were compared with the original mean values for each morphological trait, while factoring into the analysis the Wve-cluster structure obtained as described above.
Admixed genotypes (i.e. genotypes with membership probabilities <0.8) were assigned to a mixed sixth group, as in Flint-Garcia et al. (2005).
Logistic regression was carried out with 500 permutations.
For both methods, an association was indicated when the mean values of the marker classes were signiWcantly diVerent at _P_ < 0.01.
The frequency of signiWcant marker-trait relationships was calculated separately for Q-SSRs and NQ-SSRs, considering the overall morphological traits and the traits divided between those directly describing fruit size and shape (LN, BES, SES, FW, PI, FS, plus IT, because this trait was highly correlated with them; F-traits) and those unrelated to fruit dimension (GH, PH, NF, SE, GS, FC, PUF, RT; NF-traits).
The _�_
[2] homogeneity analysis was used to compare the proportions obtained for each combination, considering the two classes of markers.
The expected values were determined on the basis of the totals  of lines and columns in a 2 £ 2 table.
**Results**
Morpho-physiological analysis   The analysis of variance revealed signiWcant diVerences among genotypes for all of the traits, and signiWcant genotype £ environment interactions for all of the traits, with the exception of NF and PI (data not shown).
The Spearman rank correlation coeYcients calculated between pairs of variables (Supplementary Table S4) revealed how some were rather independent, whereas a group of traits clustered together because of a reciprocal tight correlation (Fig. 1, upper-right quadrant).
Notably, all of these traits were Ftraits, i.e. directly involved in the expression of fruit size and shape attributes.
This reXected the tendency for large fruits (high FW) to have a curved stem-end shape (high SES), a Xat blossom-end shape (low BES), a high LN, a Xat or round fruit shape (low FS) and a thin pericarp (low PI; Fig.
2d (I– III)).
These phenotypes were also signiWcantly associated with compound inXorescence (high IT, Fig. 1).
In contrast, the medium and small fruit-size genotypes were generally round or elongated, and since most of the improved material fell into this category, they had low plant heights, simple inXorescences and a thick pericarp (Fig.
2d (IV–VI)).
In the principal component analysis (PCA), the Wrst six principal coordinates (PCs) explained a total of 82% of the  ## 123   662 Theor Appl Genet (2008) 116:657–669        **GS**      |BES BES|Col2| |---|---| |**H**<br>**IT**|**PI**<br>**LN**<br>**SES**<br>**FW**<br>**FS**| ||**P**|   **SE**   **FC** **RT**    **PUF**    **Fig.

The dissimilarity matrix obtained from the morphological descriptors was used for the clustering procedure.
The resulting dendrogram displayed four major groups of genotypes (Fig. 2a).
The Wrst included all of the large-fruited  tomatoes and could be further divided into three subclus ters, representing the pear-shaped (Fig.
2a, pink stripe), the Xattened-ribbed (yellow stripe), and the ox-heart (red stripe) types, respectively.
Four genotypes remained outside of these three sub-groups.
The second major cluster included mostly the small-round and elongated types, without a clear-cut distinction based on fruit morphology (green stripe).
The two bell-pepper genotypes (IL-LBP03 and ILMBP58) were positioned in a separate, third cluster (Fig. 2a).
The last major cluster grouped the block-shaped genotypes (blue stripe), including the Rio Grande, M82 and Chico III cultivars.
Fruits of accessions representative of each cluster are documented in Fig.
2d (I–VI).
Molecular analysis   Out of the 29 SSR loci assayed, four were monomorphic overall (two Q-SSRs and two NQ-SSRs) and Wve were  ## 123    monomorphic when the _S._ _lycopersicum_ genotypes were considered (four Q-SSRs and one NQ-SSR), but showed polymorphism in the WS genotypes (Supplementary Table S3).
These nine loci were excluded from subsequent analyses.
The percentage of the SSR loci pairs in linkage disequilibrium ( _P_ < 0.001) was about 4%, with the major part representing inter-chromosomal LD (data not shown).
Of the 20 informative loci, ten were Q-SSRs and ten NQSSRs (Table 1); the two groups yielded similar levels of polymorphism.
Out of a total of 96 alleles detected in the _S. lyco-_ _
persicum_ genotypes overall, 49 were due to Q-SSRs (mean of 4.9 alleles per locus) and 47 to NQ-SSRs (4.7 alleles per locus).
In _S. lycopersicum_ genotypes, the No ranged from two to nine, with a mean of 4.8 (Table 1).
When the No was calculated on subsets of genotypes based on the germplasm categories and normalized for the number of genotypes, the WSs showed the highest mean values (data not shown).
Similarly, the WSs had the highest Ho values (Table 2).
When the genotypes were grouped on the basis of the fruit shape, as indicated by the HCA analysis based on morphology, it was conWrmed that the group of round-elongated genotypes (Fig.
2a, green stripe) was the most heterogeneous (Table 2).
The dissimilarity matrices based on the full range of morphological and molecular descriptors showed signiWcance, but were not highly correlated ( _P_ < 0.05, _r_ = 0.12).
To take into account the structure of the molecular diver sity that exists among the genotypes studied, a model-based analysis was performed using the STRUCTURE software and the data of 20 polymorphic SSR loci.
After setting to Wve the number of clusters according to the statistic of Evanno et al. (2005), the software output the coeYcients of estimated ancestry per each individual in each group.
In the plot of ancestry estimates shown in Fig.
2c in parallel with the dendrogram based on the morphological data, each individual is represented by a single horizontal bar broken into Wve segments, with lengths proportional to the individual’s estimated ancestry fraction from each of the Wve groups.
Model-based groups were mostly consistent with the morphological classiWcation.
The groups that, based on the morphology, contained the accessions with pear-shaped, Xattened-ribbed and heart-shaped fruits (Fig.
2a pink, yellow and red stripes) were paralleled, with few exceptions, by the clusters based on the SSRs (Fig.
2c pink, yellow and red bars).
The fourth SSR-based cluster (green bars) loosely corresponded to the group of small-round and elongated tomatoes (green stripe); this cluster also contained the WSs that are not reported in the dendrogram (data not shown).
Finally, the co-ancestry analysis formed a group (blue bars) that included the blockshaped cultivars (CV-CHICO, CV-RIOGR, partially CVM82); therefore, this also paralleled the clustering based on the morphology.
Some of the other diVerent genotypes revealed co-ancestry to this group (Fig. 2c).

After this distinction, the signiWcant associations between Q-SSRs and F-traits were raised to 25.7%, whereas the other groups of combinations ranged between 2.5 and 6.3% (Fig. 3a).
A similar trend was seen when the associations were calculated by logistic regression, taking into consideration the population structure (Fig. 3b).
When only the associations detected by both analyses were considered, those between Q-SSRs and F-traits remained signiWcantly higher than the other combinations (Fig.
3c; Table 3).
Some of the associations revealed by the non-parametric test were not recognized if the population structure among the genotypes was factored into the analysis.
This was the case for clear false positives, as for the association between EST258529 and FC, which was essentially due to the oxheart group sharing a speciWc, rare allele at the marker locus and the characteristic unpigmented fruit epidermis phenotype ( _y_ ; Stevens and Rick 1986; FC = 4), and between LeMDDNa and GH, which was due to a rare allele almost speciWc to cultivars with a determinate growth habit (Table 3).
Among the relationships revealed by both analyses, the TMS63 marker showed signiWcant association with FS (Table 3); almost all of the Xattened-ribbed genotypes belonging to the Marmande group had a 130-bp allele, which was also shared by other genotypes with low or medium FS index (Xattened ALs and some round genotypes; Fig. 4a).
When the test was applied to the original diameter variables, it was clear that the signiWcant association was essentially due to the polar diameter (not shown).
The EST253712 marker correlated with FW and with  traits correlated to FW, such as LN and IT (Fig. 1).
The 142-bp allele was associated with genotypes with two-loculed,   Theor Appl Genet (2008) 116:657–669 665    **Fig.

The TMS60 marker also showed signiWcant association with IT (Table 3).
After excluding the rare alleles (232, 240, and 244 bp), the signiWcance was due to the 246-bp allele (frequency, 17%) that was shared by the genotypes with the highest IT values (Fig. 4d).
The allelic composition at the TMS59 locus was signiWcantly associated with several morphological traits (Table 3).
In the _S. lycopersicum_ genotypes, the TMS59 marker showed two alleles, of 100 and 102 bp, with relative frequencies of 68 and 32%, respectively.
The 102-bp allele was preferentially shared by genotypes with low locule number (low LN; Fig. 4e), round or elongated fruits (medium-high FS; Fig.
4f), and beaked bottom-end shape (high BES).
These genotypes included all of the San Marzano and San Marzano-like accessions, the block-shaped cultivars and the ILLBP03 bell-pepper accession.
All of the other groups, plus    some small-sized cherry types (CV-VFNTC, IL-LSM49, ILSSM24), showed the 100-bp allele.
The mean values of the phenotypic class for FS were 2.1 § 0.2 for the 100-bp allele group and
4.4 § 0.2 for the 102-bp allele group.
The alleles present at the Tom236-237 marker locus were signiWcantly associated to GS.
Genotypes with a strong intensity of the shoulder preferentially showed the 180- and 181-bp alleles (Fig. 4g); these included genotypes with very diVerent fruit types, from Xattened-ribbed (ILLFR42 and IL-LFR45), to small-round (CV-AILSA, ILLSM49, IL-SSM24, and IL-SSM25), and to elongated (ILUEL14 and IL-LEL04).
While the association between TMS52 and PH did not  reveal a pattern of particular interest, that with PI was due to the 152-bp allele being speciWc to genotypes with very high pericarp index (Fig. 4h).
The LELE25 marker was the only NQ-SSR to show marker-trait associations that were signiWcant at both levels  ## 123   666 Theor Appl Genet (2008) 116:657–669    of analysis (Table 3).
This marker showed associations with LN, FW and SES due to two rather rare alleles (225 and 229 bp, with frequencies 3.4 and 8.5%, respectively) that were shared by genotypes with two-loculed, smallround fruits (CV-VFNTC and IL-LSM49 with the 225-bp allele, and CV-AILSA, CV-MONAL, IL-SSM25, ILSSM24, and AL-AREQU with the 229-bp allele).
This marker was signiWcantly associated with both fruit diameters (not shown).
**Discussion**   Morphological and molecular diversity   The genetic diversity detectable in crops by molecular markers such as SSRs is generally dependent on the mating system, the domestication history, and the magnitude of the collection being analysed.
In self-pollinating species, as the polymorphism is typically maintained between accessions, the estimated genetic diversity results in a function of the sample size.
When wide collections are addressed (e.g. more than 100 entries), numbers of alleles per polymorphic locus above 10 have commonly been reported in studies of self-pollinating crops, such as wheat (Huang et al. 2002), rice (Xu et al. 2005), and soybean (Wang et al. 2006).
In tomato, since the Wrst studies with molecular markers, it was clear that the level of genetic diversity in the cultivated gene pool was signiWcantly lower than in other selfpollinating species (Williams and St. Clair 1993).
Whereas still high numbers of alleles per polymorphic SSR locus (8.5) were reported when several wild accessions entered the collection (Alvarez et al. 2001), screenings limited to the cultivated germplasm yielded values near to 2.5 (He et al. 2003; Tam et al. 2005).
Early studies also showed that regional, traditional cultivars from South America preserved more genetic diversity than modern tomato varieties (Williams and St. Clair 1993).
Our data expand this result to the landraces diVerentiated in the Old World as we  scored a number of alleles per polymorphic locus of 4.8 (only taking into account the 59 accessions of cultivated germplasm); this value was comparable to that reported in a collection of Spanish landraces of similar magnitude (García-Martínez et al. 2006).
Because a screening of more than 500 European tomato cultivars with 20 SSR loci yielded a mean number of alleles of 4.7 (Bredemeijer et al. 2002), it can be concluded that a relatively small number of diverse landraces from relatively small geographical regions can encompass the same amount of genetic diversity that is shown by very large collections of varieties.
As it has been demonstrated that major phenotypic diVerences can often occur with only minor genotypic changes (Rick and Holle 1990;
Williams and St. Clair  ## 123    1993), a tight correlation between morphological and molecular proWling was not expected, and indeed the Mantel test between the two matrices was hardly below the threshold for statistical signiWcance.
As an example, two cultivars with rather diVerent fruit shapes, such as San Marzano and Ailsa Craig, can nevertheless show a high level of co-ancestry with both AFLPs (Park et al. 2004) and SSRs (this study).
The model-based analysis of the genetic structure in the collection studied revealed several instances of co-ancestry that were not obvious using distance-based clustering methods, but were supported by historical and pedigree information.
A high level of co-ancestry between _S. lycopersicum_ var.
_cerasiforme_ and Latin American accessions is consistent with the hypothesis that much of the diversity from _cerasiforme_ was incorporated into those regional cultivars (Rick 1976; Williams and St. Clair 1993).
High co-ancestry to _S. lycopersicum_ var.
_cerasiforme_ also characterised all of the cherry types (sometimes referred to as _cerasiforme_ germplasm themselves), and the modern M82 cultivar and some of the old cultivars, like San Marzano and the derivative Corbarino landrace (IL-SEL33), which experienced introgressions from wild germplasm (Monti et al. 2004).
Co-ancestry to this group was never found for the pearshaped, heart-shaped or Xattened-ribbed types.
Marker-trait associations   One of the reported constraints of association mapping studies is the easy detection of false positives resulting from the existence of genetic structure in the populations studied (Flint-Garcia et al. 2005).
In addition to factoring the genetic structure into the analysis, the reliability of association studies has been addressed through case studies of previously known genes (Aranzana et al. 2005).
Similarly, we carried out association studies in tomato by using a set of markers located in the same genomic region of known QTLs that contribute to fruit size and shape.
The results demonstrate that this approach can be eYcient in tomato because the proportion of signiWcant associations was signiWcantly higher when Q-SSRs were compared with F-traits than in all of the other combinations.
Moreover, four out of Wve NQ-SSRs that gave signiWcant marker-trait associations have actually not been precisely mapped yet, and thus they could be linked either to reported or unreported QTLs.
It can be reasonably predicted that a suitable choice of markers, genotypes and traits can provide an analytical platform that is useful for the performance of genome-wide association mapping scans and to obtain insights into the function of speciWc QTLs over the phenotypic germplasm variation.
To translate this information into tools for marker-assisted breeding would then be straightforward.
Theor Appl Genet (2008) 116:657–669 667    Our set of markers addressed six out of the nine key loci described as controlling size and shape variation in tomato (Tanksley 2004); only _fw4.1_, _fasciated_ ( _f_ ) and _ovate_ ( _o_ ) had no linked SSR analysed in this study.
Of the linked markers, two showed signiWcant associations with FW and/or FS (addressing the regions of _fw1.1_ and _fs8.1_ ; see below) and three were monomorphic.
One of these was Tom178–179, a marker located on chromosome 2, in a region which could span both locule number (ln), one of the two loci mainly controlling the number of carpels (Barrero and Tanksley 2004), and _fw2.2_, one of the major QTLs involved in tomato domestication that accounts for approximately 30% of the variance in fruit weight (Frary et al. 2000).
Tom178– 179 was monomorphic in our 59 cultivated genotypes, but in _S. lycopersicum_ var.
_cerasiforme_ and in _S. pimpinellifo-_ _lium_ it showed two alleles that were diVerent to that found  in _S. lycopersicum_ (Supplementary Table S3).
This conWrms the allelic Wxation at this genomic region in the cultivated germplasm reported in previous studies (Nesbitt and Tanksley 2002; Tanksley 2004).
Allelic Wxation in cultivated germplasm for regions spanning key genes for tomato domestication is also suggested, as the majority (four out of Wve) of the markers that were monomorphic in _S. lycopersi-_ _cum_ but polymorphic in the wild species were Q-SSRs.
Among the associations found with previously known QTLs, the TMS63 marker, located in the genomic region of _fw1.1_ (Grandillo et al. 1999) and of several QTLs for fruit shape (Van der Knaap and Tanksley 2003), was actually associated with FS.
This was in agreement with the concept that FW and FS show a highly signiWcant correlation (Van der Knaap and Tanksley 2003) and that the presence of QTLs for fruit length ( _X1.1_ ) and diameter ( _fd1.1_ ) have also been reported in this region (Lippman and Tanksley 2001).
Similarly, the EST253712 marker, which is located near to a reported QTL for fruit weight on chromosome 6 (MF6a, Paterson et al _._ 1991), was associated with FW and to correlated traits in this study.
The TMS60 marker, which is linked to a QTL for fruit shape ( _ljfs7_, Van der Knaap et al. 2002), was associated with IT because of a speciWc allele in the group of genotypes with pear-shaped fruits that typically shows double or compound inXorescence (IT > 1).
It would be of interest to investigate whether this marker also reXects the presence of LD with QTLs for fruit weight and shape located in its proximity, but that do not contribute to its deWnition as a QSSR ( _fw7.2_, Grandillo et al. 1999;
_sun_, Van der Knaap and Tanksley 2001; _sblk7.1_ and _hrt7.1_, Van der Knaap and Tanksley 2003).
As TMS59 is located on chromosome 8 (Areshchenkova and Ganal 2002) at a location that is linked to _fs8.1_, which is a major QTL
that deWnes the largest portion of the phenotypic variation for fruit shape (Grandillo et al. 1999; Ku et al. 2000; Van der Knaap and Tanksley 2003), it is likely    that the polymorphism found at this marker locus mirrors diVerent allelic compositions of _fs8.1_ .
LN and BES are traits that correlate with FS (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table S4).
This LD is consistent with the concept that _
fs8.1_ is located near to the centromere, where recombination is suppressed (Grandillo et al. 1996).
_
fs8.1_ has been reported to control ovary growth before anthesis in only the longitudinal dimension (Ku et al. 2000), although here when this marker was tested against the original fruit diameters, it showed a higher association with ED than PD (not shown).
This supports the more recent concept that _
fs8.1_ has a role in the expression of bumpiness (Van der Knaap and Tanksley 2003), a trait largely dependent on equatorial growth.
Thus, if the allelic composition at the TMS59 locus truly reXects diVerent alleles of the QTL, then the role of _fs8.1_ can be extended to a more general control of tomato fruitshape variation, from Xat to extremely elongated.
The TMS52 marker, which is linked on chromosome 12 to a QTL for FS and one for LN (Van der Knaap and Tanksley 2003), was associated with PH and PI.
The 152bp allele was shared by the genotypes with fruits with the highest PI values.
The same allele also caused an association with FW, although in a structure-dependent fashion, as it was speciWc to small-fruited genotypes.
Because this allele was also present in _S. lycopersicum_ var.
_cerasiforme_ and in a further eight small-sized, cherry-type tomatoes not included in the collection (not shown), this suggests the presence of LD with a QTL responsible for fruit size (indeed, a minor QTL for fruit weight, _fw12.2_, is linked to TMS52; Grandillo et al. 1999).
If this is the case, the presence of the 152-bp allele, which probably derives from _S._ _lycopersicum_ var.
_cerasiforme_, represents an important contribution towards the expression of the small-round, cherry-type fruit phenotype.
In addition to the associations that have indicated previously reported QTLs, our investigation has also shown that loci deWned as NQ-SSRs show association to the phenotype.
One of these, the LELE25 marker, has been localised to chromosome 10 (Bredemeijer et al. 2002) and showed  association with LN and the correlated traits of SES and  FW.
While the major genes controlling for LN are on diVerent chromosomes ( _f_ on chromosome 11, and _ln_ on chromosome 2; Barrero and Tanksley 2004), a QTL for  locule number has also been localised to chromosome 10  ( _lcn10.1_, Van der Knaap and Tanksley 2003), and thus the allelic composition of LELE25 may reXect a linkage with  _lcn10.1_ .
The present study has demonstrated that tomato landraces that are still grown in Italy maintain a high level of genetic diversity, and that molecular Wngerprinting based on SSRs is a very attractive way for the implementation of association analysis in tomato.
The landraces therefore oVer a choice of genotypes that represent a “pseudo-segregant  ## 123   668 Theor Appl Genet (2008) 116:657–669    population”, which is useful for the simultaneous evaluation of numerous traits with multiallelic loci, whereas one or a few traits and only two alleles per locus are available in biparental crosses used in classical QTL analysis (FlintGarcia et al. 2005).
This approach provides a wider perspective on the action of known QTLs, and helps in the identiWcation of new marker-trait relationships.
