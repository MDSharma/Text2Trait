[1]** **has** **led to reduced genetic diversity.
As a result, beneficial traits of** **wild species, such as disease resistance and stress tolerance,** **have been lost** **[2]** **.
We devised a CRISPR–Cas9 genome** **engineering strategy to combine agronomically desirable traits** **with useful traits present in wild lines.
We report that editing of** **six loci that are important for yield and productivity in present-** **day tomato crop lines enabled** _**de novo**_ **domestication of wild** _**Solanum pimpinellifolium.
**_ **Engineered** _**S. pimpinellifolium**_ **morphology was altered, together with the size, number and** **nutritional value of the fruits.
Compared with the wild parent,** **our engineered lines have a threefold increase in fruit size** **and a tenfold increase in fruit number.
Notably, fruit lycopene** **accumulation is improved by 500% compared with the widely** **cultivated** _**S. lycopersicum**_ **.
Our results pave the way for** **molecular breeding programs to exploit the genetic diversity** **present in wild plants.
**   Tomato ( _S. lycopersicum_ ) is the most important vegetable fruit world­ wide, with annual production of 100 million tons [3] .
The domestication process from the putative ancestral progenitor, _S. pimpinellifolium_, which produces pea-sized fruits, to modern tomato varieties is well described [4] .
However, despite the increases in yield conferred by domestication, the breeding focus on yield has been accompanied by a loss of genetic diversity and reduced nutritional value and taste [5] .
Many domestication traits have Mendelian inheritance patterns and involve loss-of-function or gain-of function mutations [6] ( **Table 1** and **Supplementary Table 1** ).
This means that it should be possible to rec­ reate these traits in a suitable genetic background with CRISPR–Cas9 genome editing technology
[7] .
Although the first CRISPR–Cas9 appli­ cations created deletions, modern variants of CRISPR-based genome editing technologies can produce targeted insertions, exchange amino acids and modulate gene expression.
Therefore, genome editing could be used to domesticate wild plants and reunite lost but desirable traits, including nutritional features or stress tolerance, with yield potential and other agronomically valuable characteristics [8] .
We previously identified a suite of loci that have shaped the mor­ phology and agronomic potential of current cultivars of tomato, maize, rice and other crops and proposed a reverse genetic approach for the _de novo_ domestication of novel crops
[9] ( **Table 1** and **Supplementary** **Table 1** ).
In tomato, at least six loci important for key domestica­ tion traits have been identified: general plant growth habit ( _SELF-_ _PRUNING_ )
[10], fruit shape ( _OVATE_ )
[11] and size ( _FASCIATED_ and _FRUIT WEIGHT 2.2_ )
[12,13], fruit number ( _MULTIFLORA_ )
[14], and nutritional quality ( _LYCOPENE BETA CYCLASE_ )
[15] .
We set out to create a novel crop derived from _S. pimpinellifolium_ by targeting this set of genes using a multiplex CRISPR–Cas9 approach to generate loss-of-function alleles.
We constructed a single CRISPR–Cas9 plant transformation vector, pTC321 ( **Supplementary Note 1** ), which har­ bored six single guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting specific sequences in the coding regions of all six genes ( **Supplementary Fig.
1** ).
Using this vector, we generated ten primary T 0 lines, of which three were grown to maturity.
T 1 seeds were harvested from plant 3, which showed an oval fruit phenotype, indicative of successful editing of the _ovate_ locus, and determinate growth habit, indicative of loss of function of the _self-_ _pruning_ gene.
Sequencing of all six targeted loci in 50 T 1 lines revealed that four of the six targeted loci were successfully edited in all 50 lines and harbored indel mutations ( **Supplementary Tables 2** and **3** ).
The four edited genes were _SELF-PRUNING_ ( _SP_ ), _OVATE_ ( _O_ ), _FRUIT_ _
WEIGHT 2.2_ ( _FW2.2_ ) and _LYCOPENE BETA CYCLASE_ ( _CycB_ ).
For all four edited genes, we recovered only edited alleles and did not detect any wild-type (WT) alleles in the T 1 generation ( **Supplementary** **Datasets 1** and **2** ).
However, we did not recover any mutations in either _FASCIATED_ ( _FAS_ ) or _MULTIFLORA_ ( _MULT_ ).
In the case of _FAS_ we identified a G-to-A substitution in the _S. pimpinellifolium_ genome at the gRNA target site (designed based on the _S. lycopersicum_ genome) and the targeted _S. pimpinellifolium_ sequence, which may have prevented editing ( **Supplementary Tables 2** and **3** ).
To address the specificity of our multiplex editing approach, we sequenced the two most closely related off-target loci (as determined by _in silico_ analysis using Geneious R11 program) for each gRNA in two pTC321 plant 3 lines ( **Supplementary Fig.
2** ).

Next we examined the phenotypes of two T 2 plant lines (desig­ nated as line 3-5 and line 3-11).
The parental T 1 plants of both 3-5 and 3-11 contained homozygous deletions in the second exon of the gene encoding SP ( **Fig.
1a** ).
Breeding an _sp_ allele with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the coding region into tomato cultivars was instrumental in enabling the mechanical harvest of fruits [16] .
Similarly, loss of SP function in _S. pimpinellifolium_ resulted in compact plants with reduced height, reduced number of sympodial units and determinate growth when compared with WT _S. pimpinellifolium_ ( **Fig.
1b–g** ).
In the fruit-shape-determining _OVATE_ ( _O_ ) locus, genome editing had induced distinct homozygous deletions in the first exon of the gene in both T 1 parents ( **Fig.
1h** ).
As predicted, loss of _O_ gene function in both alleles caused an oval fruit shape ( **Fig.
1i–m** ).
The elongated form of fruits occurs through reduced internal fruit pressure and is associated with less rain-induced fruit cracking, a detrimental trait in tomato production
[17] .
In the _FRUIT WEIGHT 2.2_ ( _FW2.2_ ) locus, we identified two independ­ ent homozygous deletions that disrupted the coding frame of exon 2 ( **Supplementary Fig. 3** ).
Surprisingly, despite these mutations, we did not detect any discernible change in fruit sizes in these T 2 mutant lines compared with WT _S. pimpinellifolium_ ( **Supplementary Table 4** ).
During the course of our experimental program, we learned that the gene locus responsible for the multilocular fruit phenotype of _FAS_ is not encoded by a YABBY transcription factor, as was previously pro­ posed [18], but instead results from a mutation in _CLAVATA3_ ( _CLV3_ )
[12] .
Therefore, we carried out a second round of genome engineering to generate multiplex-edited plants in which the selection of target genes focused on modulating fruit size ( _FW2.2_, _FAS_ ) and number ( _MULT_ ), as well as nutritional value ( _LYCOPENE BETA CYCLASE_, _CycB_ ).
We designed a CRISPR–Cas9 plant transformation vector named pTC603 ( **Supplementary Note 2** ), which harbored eight gRNAs targeting two sites in the coding region of each of these four genes ( **Supplementary** **Fig. 1** ).
Three successfully transformed T 0 lines were identified ( **Supplementary Fig. 4** ).
Sequencing of T 0 plants 5 and 8 identi­ fied loss-of-function mutations in all four targeted loci in both lines ( **Supplementary Fig. 5** and **Supplementary Dataset 2** ).
Target locus analysis in 28 individual T 1 representatives derived from both T 0 plants 5 and 8 revealed that in every T 1 plant all four target loci were success­ fully edited ( **Supplementary Dataset 1** ).
In _CycB_ and _FW2.2_
we identi­ fied two different mutation events and in _CLV3_ three different mutation  events homozygous mutations or heterozygous (biallelic) combinations of mutant alleles.
Either type of mutation resulted in a loss of function of the edited gene.
For _MULT_, we recovered 5 T 1 plants possessing two    WT alleles and 23 heterozygous T 1 plants ( **Supplementary Table 5** ).
We examined the two most closely related genomic sequences for each gRNA (as determined by _in silico_ analysis using the Geneious R11 pro­ gram) and did not observe off-target editing in ten analyzed T 1 plants ( **Supplementary Fig.
2** ).
To summarize, in two separate experiments we engineered two sets of four target domestication genes simultane­ ously and generated a diverse range of combinations of 15 independent loss-of-function alleles ( **Supplementary Tables 3** and **4** ).
We phenotyped the second set of edited plant lines.
Introduction of a loss-of-function _MULT_ allele into cultivated tomato resulted in a higher number of fruits per truss, conferring enhanced yield [14] .
In our edited plant lines, we identified a single heterozygous mutation (2-bp deletion) in exon 2 ( **Fig.
2a** and **Supplementary Fig.
5** ) of _MULT.
_
Edited plants had the predicted branched inflorescence phenotype (T 1, **Fig.
2b–d** ; T 0, **Supplementary Fig. 6** ).
Both T 1 lines also harbored homozygous indel mutations in both the first and the second exon of the _FW2.2_  gene ( **Supplementary Fig.
5** ).
Moreover, T 1 lines 5 and 8 also carried biallelic deletions in exon 1 and a heterozygous deletion in exon 2 of the _CLV3_ gene ( **Fig.
2e
** ), which corresponded with phenotypes that have been attributed to the _FAS_ locus ( **Fig.
2f,g** ).
Characterization of fruit morphology revealed a fourfold increase in fruit locule number and a fruit weight increased up to 200% compared with _S. pimpinellifolium_ ( **Fig.
2h,i** ).
Considering the absence of a discernible fruit phenotype in the lines in which _FW2.2_ but not _FAS_ was mutated ( **Supplementary** **Fig. 3** and **Supplementary Table 4** ), we conclude that increased fruit size ( **Fig.
2j**, **k** ) is due to the loss of function of _CLV3_ .
Since the classical _fw2.2_ mutation, which affects fruit size, causes a heterochronic altera­ tion in the _FW2.2_ expression pattern, we suggest that changes in _FW2.2_ expression, but not loss of function, affect tomato fruit size [13] .
Nutritional value and taste have largely been neglected in conventional breeding [19] .
The content of lycopene and β-carotene largely determines the nutritional value of tomato
[20] .
Anti-inflamma­ tory properties and the reduction of cardiovascular and cancer risks have also been correlated with dietary intake of lycopene [21] .
In addi­ tion, while β-carotene occurs in sufficient amounts in many vegeta­ bles, lycopene is generally not present in sufficient concentration
[22] .
In cultivated tomato, the activity of lycopene β-cyclase converts a substantial fraction of lycopene into β-carotene, thereby reduc­ ing the content of beneficial lycopene [15] .
While cultivated cherry tomato fruits accumulate around 60–120
mg
kg
[−1] lycopene [23,24], this antioxidant accumulates to levels of up to 270 mg kg
[−1] in _S. pimpinellifolium_
[25,26] .
The genetic bases determining lycopene accumulation in tomato are only poorly understood and most likely polygenic [27] .
Accordingly, previous attempts to enhance lycopene    **1212** VOLUME 36 NUMBER 12 DECEMBER 2018 **nature biotechnology**   content of commercial tomato yielded only moderate success or resulted in enhanced lycopene accumulation at the cost of reduced β-carotene abundance
[15,28] .
l e t t e r   We targeted the _CycB_ gene in both experiments to evaluate whether we could exploit the lycopene accumulation phenotype of _S. pimpinel­_ _lifolium_ .

tomatoes cv.
Micro-Tom (MT) and those of wild and edited _S. pimpinel­_ _lifolium_ lines revealed values of 92, 234, and 510 mg kg
[−1] of lycopene, respectively ( **Fig.
3g** and **Supplementary Tables 6** and **7** ).
This repre­ sents more than 100% higher accumulation of lycopene in the edited lines when compared with the parent species.
Further, this value is more than 500% higher than concentrations commonly found in commercial cherry tomatoes [23,24] .
Importantly, this improvement in lycopene con­ tent did not negatively affect the accumulation of β-carotene or lutein ( **Supplementary Fig. 8** ).
Finally, we monitored the stability of the observed phenotypes in the T 2 (pTC603) and T 3 (pTC321) generations and verified their occurrence independent of the Cas9 transgene.
Diagnostic PCR anal­ yses identified transgene-free plants that had all of the domestication phenotypes ( **Supplementary Fig. 9** ).
Important traits such as Brix value, fruit shape and locule number were uniformly inherited in the T 2 (pTC603) and T 3 (pTC321) generations ( **Supplementary Figs. 10** and **11** and **Supplementary Tables 8** and **9** )
In this report we provide evidence that targeted reverse genetic engineering of wild plants could rapidly create new crops.
We demon­ strate that simultaneous CRISPR–Cas9 editing of six genes resulted in modification of fruit number, size, shape, nutrient content and plant architecture in a single generation and within a single transformation experiment.
Recently, a complementary promoter editing approach has been applied to create genetic variability and reverse the negative effects of domestication history in order to aid breeding of beneficial traits in tomato
[29] .
Combining this synthetic genetic variability method with _de novo_ domestication could boost efforts to rapidly engineer better crops.
Importantly, domestication traits have also been characterized in many crops, including maize, wheat and sorghum [6,30], meaning that our approach could be broadly applied [9] .

**1216** VOLUME 36 NUMBER 12 DECEMBER 2018 **nature biotechnology**   **ONLINE METHODS**  **Molecular cloning and plant transformation.
** CRISPR–Cas9 plant trans­ formation vectors were constructed using protocols 3A and 5 of Čermák _et al._
[7] .
The vector pTC321 (35S::Csy4-P2A-AtCas9, 35S::gRNA-array) express­ ing a Csy4 array of six gRNAs targeting _SELF PRUNING_ ( _Solyc06g074350_ ), _OVATE_ ( _Solyc02g085500_ ), _FRUIT WEIGHT 2.2_ ( _Solyc02g090730_ ), _LYCOPENE_ _BETA-CYCLASE_ ( _Solyc04g040190_ ), _MULTIFLORA_ ( _Solyc02g077390_ ) and _FASCIATED/YABBY_ ( _Solyc11g071810_ ) was constructed by direct assembly
[of gRNAs into the T-DNA vector pDIRECT_22C (Addgene plasmid 91135)](https://www.addgene.org/91135/91135) (see **Supplementary Table 10** for gRNA sequences).
Vector pTC603 (35S:: Csy4-P2A-AtCas9, CmYLCV::gRNA-array) expressing a Csy4 array of eight gRNAs targeting _FASCIATED_ / _CLAVATA3_ ( _Solyc11g071380_ ), _FRUIT WEIGHT_ _2.2_ ( _Solyc02g090730_ ), _MULTIFLORA_ ( _Solyc02g077390_ ) _and LYCOPENE_ _BETA-CYCLASE_ ( _Solyc04g040190_ ) was constructed in two steps.
The first six [gRNAs were cloned into pMOD_B2103 (Addgene plasmid 91061) and the](https://www.addgene.org/91061/91061)
[last two gRNAs into pMOD_C2200 (Addgene plasmid 91082).
The gRNA](https://www.addgene.org/91082/91082) arrays in the resulting plasmids were assembled along with pMOD_A0501 (35S:Csy4-P2A-AtCas9, Addgene plasmid [91011) into the T-DNA vector](https://www.addgene.org/91011/91011)
[pTRANS_220 (Addgene plasmid 91113).
The final array contains the gRNAs](https://www.addgene.org/91113/91113) in the following order: gRNAs 41 and 42 targeting _FAS/CLV3_, gRNAs 15 and 16 targeting _FW2.2_, gRNAs 19 and 20 targeting _MULTIFLORA_ and gRNAs 17 and 18 targeting _CycB_ ( **Supplementary Fig.
1** and **Supplementary** **Table 10** ).
The pTC321 ( **Supplementary Note 1** ) and pTC603 ( **Supplementary Note 2** ) vectors were introduced into the _Agrobacterium tumefaciens_ strain LBA4404 by electroporation.
Agrobacteria were cultured in 3 mL of liquid LB medium supplemented with 50 mg L
[−1] kanamycin and 50 mg L
[−1] rifampicin and incu­ bated at 28 °C for 24 h at 120 r.p.m.
From this culture, 500 µL were added to 50 mL of fresh LB medium with the same antibiotics as above.
The culture  was incubated overnight under the same conditions and then centrifuged at 2,000 _g_ for 15 min at room temperature.
The pellet was resuspended in liquid Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium [41] to an OD 600 of 0.25–0.3; acetosyringone was added to a final concentration of 100 µM before plant inoculation.
_S. pimpinellifolium_ (LA1589) was transformed as previously published [42] with the following modifications: seeds were surface-sterilized by shaking in 20 mL 30% (v/v) commercial bleach (2.7% sodium hypochlorite) supplemented with two drops of commercial detergent for 15 min, followed by three rinses with sterile water.
Seeds were germinated on semi-solid MS medium (sup­ plemented with 0.6 g/L agar) and incubated at 25 ± 1 °C in the dark for 4 d. After this period, seeds were transferred and maintained at 25 ± 1 °C under long-day conditions (16 h light/ 8 h dark) with 45 µmol photons m [−2] s [−1] PAR irradiance.
Leaf explants (1–2 cm
[2] ) were isolated from 2-week-old _in vitro_ plants and placed with the abaxial side down onto MS medium containing 1 mg L
[−1] _trans_ -zeatin, 0.1 mg L
[−1] indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and 100 µM acetosyrin­ gone.
Two drops of _Agrobacterium_ suspension were applied per explant and plates were then incubated at room temperature for 10 min.
Thereafter, excess bacterial suspension was removed, and explants were blotted dry on sterile filter paper.
Plates were maintained in the dark at 25 °C for 2 d for cocultiva­ tion.
Explants were transferred to plates with MS medium containing 1 mg L
[−1] _trans_ -zeatin, 0.1 mg L
[−1] IAA, 300 mg L [−1] timentin, 100 mg L
[−1] kanamycin.
After 5 weeks, shoot primordia emerging from callus tissue were isolated and transferred to shoot elongation medium (MS medium supplemented with 0.5 mg L
[−1] _trans_ -zeatin, 300 mg L
[−1] timentin, 100 mg L
[−1] kanamycin) to recover full plants.
After acclimation, these plants were grown in a greenhouse at 30 °C/26 °C day/night temperature and 60–75% ambient relative humidity, 11.5 h/13 h (winter/summer) photoperiod, sunlight 250–350 µmol photons m [−2] s [−1] PAR irradiance, attained by a reflecting mesh (Aluminet, Polysack Indústrias Ltda, Leme, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil), and automatic irrigation four times a day for fruit set.
Seeds from transformed plants were germinated in 350-mL pots with a 1:1 mixture of commercial potting mix Basaplant (Base Agro, Artur Nogueira, SP, Brazil) and expanded vermiculite supplemented with 1 g L
[−1] 10:10:10 NPK and 4 g L
[−1] dolomite limestone (MgCO 3 plus CaCO 3 ).
Upon appearance of the first true leaf, seedlings of each genotype were transplanted to 10-L pots containing the soil mix described above, except for NPK supplementation, which was increased to 8 g L
[−1] .
After transplanting, plants were sprayed twice at 14-d    intervals with 1 g L
[−1] Peters 20-20-20 leaf fertilizer.
Acclimatized plants were pollinated by hand, producing T 1 seeds and the following generations.
Seeds and vectors are available upon request from the corresponding authors [see (https://www.uni-muenster.de/Biologie.IBBP/agkudla/Plasmids.html)](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Biologie.IBBP/agkudla/Plasmids.html) _._
**Genotyping of T** **0** **and T** **1** **plants.
**
The gRNA target sites were amplified by PCR directly from leaf tissue with the Phire Plant Direct PCR Master Mix following the Dilution & Storage protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or from extracted genomic DNA with Phusion polymerase (New England BioLabs), using primers listed in **Supplementary Table 11** .
Primers and dNTPs were removed using ExoSAP (0.5 U exonuclease I + 0.25 U FastAP thermosensitive alkaline phosphatase in 35 µL of PCR, incubated 30 min at 37 °C and heatinactivated for 5 min at 95 °C) and the purified PCR products were directly sequenced.
Heterozygous and biallelic mutations were identified as overlap­ ping sequence traces.
These samples were cloned and several clones sequenced to determine the sequences of individual alleles.
**Off-target identification and analysis.
**
The “Find CRISPR sites” function in Geneious R11 was used to search for off-target binding sites in _S. pimpinel­_ _lifolium_ genome
[43]
[(https://solgenomics.net/organism/Solanum_pimpinellifo­](https://solgenomics.net/organism/Solanum_pimpinellifolium/genome)
[lium/genome).
A maximum of eight mismatches and zero indels were allowed](https://solgenomics.net/organism/Solanum_pimpinellifolium/genome) between the on- and off-target sequences.
The two top scoring off-target sites were PCR amplified and sequenced.
Primers can be found in **Supplementary** **Table 12** .
**Plant material and growth conditions.
** Plants were cultivated in semicon­ trolled conditions in a greenhouse in Viçosa (642 m asl, 20° 45′ S, 42° 51′ W), Minas Gerais, Brazil.
Wild-type _S. pimpinellifolium_ plants were grown along­ side T 2 of pTC321-, T 3 of pTC321- and T 1 of pTC603-transformed plants dur­ ing the months of October 2016 to January 2017, August 2017 to November 2017 and August 2017 to November 2017, respectively.
For plants of genera­ tions T 3 of pTC321 and T 1 of pTC603, the main stem was trained on bamboo sticks and side branches were pruned, leaving a total of three inflorescences per plant.
The greenhouse temperature ranged between 24 and 20 °C, with a 13-h/11-h (day/night) photoperiod and an average irradiance of 800 µmol photons m [
−2] s [−1] .
Seeds were germinated in plastic trays with commercial substrate Tropstrato and supplemented with 1 g L
[−1] 10:10:10 NPK and 4 g L
[−1] dolomite limestone (MgCO 3 plus CaCO 3 ).
Weekly foliar fertilization was carried out using 2 g/L Biofert leaf fertilizer.
Upon appearance of the first true leaves, seedlings of each genotype were transplanted to 5-L pots.
The new pots were filled with substrate as described above, except for the NPK supplementation, which was increased to 8 g L
[−1] .
Irrigation was performed twice a day in a controlled manner, so that each vessel received the same volume of water.
**Carotenoid quantification and sampling.
** Fruits were harvested at the ‘red ripe’ stage sequentially over a period of 2 weeks.
They were cut in half and the seeds were removed, after which the fruits were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a freezer at −80 °C until analysis.
Fruit carotenoid extraction was carried out following an adaptation of a previously published protocol [44] .
Frozen fruits were ground in a ball mill (Retsch, model MM400) and 200-mg aliquots subsequently collected in 2-mL microtubes.
During the extraction, samples were kept cooled on ice in an environment with reduced luminosity (30–50 µmol photons m [−2] s [−1] irradiance).
100 µL of saturated NaCl solution (370 g/L) were added to each sample and mixed by vortexing for 30 s. 200 µL of dichloromethane were added next and mixed by vortexing.
Finally, 500 µL of hexane:ethyl ether (1:1) were added and the sample homogenized by vortexing.
Samples were then centrifuged (Eppendorf 5415R micro-centrifuge) (4 °C, 13,000 _g_ for 5 min).
The supernatant was then collected and transferred to a 2-mL amber microtube.
Addition of hexane:ethyl ether (1:1), vortex agita­ tion, centrifugation and collection of the upper organic phase (supernatant) were repeated three times, until whitening of the samples was observed in the microtube, showing the appropriate extraction of most carotenoids.
Samples were completely dried in a vacuum concentrator (CentriVap, Labconco), resus­ pended in 300 µL of ethyl acetate and mixed for 30 s. All supernatant fractions were combined, completely dried by vacuum, filtered through a 0.45 µm mem­ brane filter and suspended with 100 µL of ethyl acetate.
Chromatography was    doi:10.1038/nbt.4272 **nature biotechnology**   carried out on Agilent Technologies series 1100 HPLC system on a normal-phase Phenomenex column (Luna C18; 250 × 4.6 mm; 5 µm particle diameter) with a flow rate of 1 mL min [−1] and temperature 25 °C.
The mobile phase was a gradient of ethyl acetate (A) and acetonitrile:water 9:1 (v/v) (B): 0–4 min: 20% A; 4–30 min: 20–65% A; 30–35 min: 65% A; 35–40 min: 65–20% A. Eluted compounds were detected between 340 and 700 nm and quantified at 450 nm.
The endogenous metabolite concentration was obtained by compar­ ing the peak areas of the chromatograms with commercial standards (SigmaAldrich).
The extraction of corolla and anther samples were performed in a similar way to that of fruits, but with the following modifications: after harvesting, the samples were lyophilized and stored in a refrigerator until the extraction process.
The period between freeze-drying and carotenoid extraction was less than 10 d. Lyophilized samples were ground in reaction tubes with the help of a plastic pestle.
Anther samples contained on average 14 mg of dry mass, corolla samples 10 mg.
Samples were rehydrated in 300 µL ultrapure water and subjected to the extraction process and HPLC quantification.
**Brix determination.
**
The total content of soluble solids in fruits (measured as Brix) was determined for the ‘red ripe’ fruits stage by means of a digital bench refractometer (Instrutherm Model RTD-45).
First the apparatus was calibrated with distilled water; after drying the prism, the liquid of each fruit was placed in the prism of the refractometer and thus quantified.
The Brix of each replicate (each plant) was composed of analyzes of many fruits.
**Phenotypic parameters of the fruits.
**
The phenotypic parameters of the fruits (mass, length and equatorial width) were determined using precision bal­ ances (Micronal B160) and a digital caliper (MTX) using at least 10 fruits per plant.
**Statistics.
**
The quantitative parameters studied here show continuous variation and were therefore analyzed using parametric tests: Student’s _t_ -test was done on GraphPad; ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests were performed using VassarStats [(http://vassarstats.net).
Percentage data were converted to the inverse func­](http://vassarstats.net) tion (1/ _X_ ) before analysis.
All information on replication, statistical test and presentation are given in the respective figure legends.
