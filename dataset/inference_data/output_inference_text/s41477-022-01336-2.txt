Here we show in transient assays and stable transgenic plants that the connection to ubiquitination pathways suggested by the UFO F-box domain is mostly dispensable.
On the basis of biochemical and genome-wide studies, we establish that UFO instead acts by forming an active transcriptional complex with LFY at newly discovered regulatory elements.
Structural characterization of the LFY–UFO–DNA complex by cryo-electron microscopy further demonstrates that UFO performs this function by directly interacting with both LFY and DNA.
Finally, we propose that this complex might have a deep evolutionary origin, largely predating flowering plants.
This work reveals a unique mechanism of an F-box protein directly modulating the DNA binding specificity of a master transcription factor.
The formation of flowers is key to the reproductive success of angiosperms.
Flowers are made of four types of organs (sepals, petals, stamens and carpels) arranged in concentric whorls.
The patterning of flower meristems requires the localized induction of the ABCE floral homeotic genes that determine specific floral organ identities.
In _Arabidopsis thaliana_, this developmental step is largely controlled by the master transcription factor (TF) LEAFY (LFY) that activates the ABCE genes [1][,][2] .
LFY directly activates the A class gene _APETALA1_ ( _AP1_ )
uniformly in the early flower meristem [3][,][4], while activations of B and C    genes are local and require the activity of cofactors.
For instance, LFY regulates the C class gene _
AGAMOUS_ ( _AG_ )
in conjunction with the TF WUSCHEL to specify third whorl (stamen) and fourth whorl (carpel) identities [5] .
The activation of the B class gene _APETALA3_ ( _AP3_ ), necessary to specify the identity of the second (petal) and third whorls of the flower, requires the combined activity of LFY and the spatially delineated cofactor UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS (UFO)
[6][–][8] .
In _Arabidopsis_, the main function of LFY and UFO is to activate _AP3_ (ref.
[9] ), but in numerous species (such as rice, wheat, tomato and petunia), their joint role    1 Laboratoire Physiologie Cellulaire et Végétale, IRIG-DBSCI-LPCV, Université Grenoble Alpes, CEA, CNRS, INRAE, Grenoble, France.

[10][–][13] .
At the molecular level, little is known on the nature of LFY–UFO synergy.
Unlike most floral regulators, _UFO_ encodes not for a TF but for an F-box protein, one of the first to be described in plants [14][–][16] .
UFO is part of a SKP1–Cullin1–F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex through the interaction of its F-box domain with ARABIDOPSIS SKP1-LIKE (ASK) proteins
[15][,][17] .
In addition, its predicted carboxy-terminal Kelch-type β-propeller domain physically interacts with LFY DNA Binding Domain (DBD)
[18] .
As the control of TF activity through proteolytic and non-proteolytic ubiquitination is a well-described mechanism [19], it has been suggested that LFY is targeted for ubiquitination and possibly degradation by the SCF [UFO] complex.
Other data have shown that adding a repression or activation domain to UFO changes its activity and that UFO is recruited at the _AP3_ promoter in a LFY-dependent manner, suggesting a more direct role of UFO in gene regulation [18][,][20] .
However, direct evidence explaining how UFO regulates a specific subset of LFY targets was still missing, and the molecular mechanism underlying LFY–UFO synergistic action remained elusive.
Here we show that the connection of UFO to the SCF complex is largely dispensable for this protein’s activity and that an important role of UFO is to form a transcriptional complex with LFY at genomic sites devoid of canonical high-affinity LFY binding sites (LFYBS).
Our study presents a unique mechanism by which an F-box protein acts as an integral part of a transcriptional complex.
**The UFO F-box domain is partially dispensable for** **its floral role**  A dual luciferase reporter assay (DLRA) in _Arabidopsis_ protoplasts was used to study floral promoter activation by LFY and UFO.
We used promoter versions known to allow full complementation of mutants or to be able to recapitulate a wild-type (WT) expression pattern (Methods).
We found that the _AP3_ promoter ( _pAP3_ ) was more strongly activated when LFY (or LFY–VP16, a fusion of LFY with the VP16 activation domain) was co-expressed with UFO (or UFO–VP16) than by either effector alone (Fig.
1a,e).
Similar results were obtained with the promoter of _RABBIT EARS_ ( _RBE_ ), another UFO target (Fig. 1b)
[21] .
We also analysed the promoters of _AP1_ ( _pAP1_ ) and _AG_ ( _pAG_ ), two LFY targets regulated independently of UFO [3][,][4][,][22] that are required for organ identity of the first and second ( _AP1_ ) or third and fourth ( _AG_ ) floral whorls.
We found that their activation by LFY and LFY–VP16 was insensitive to UFO (Fig.
1c,d).
Thus, the protoplast assay accurately reproduced several floral promoter activation patterns.
We next investigated the involvement of an SCF [UFO] -dependent ubiquitination pathway in _pAP3_ activation by LFY–UFO.
We found that, when co-expressed with LFY, amino-terminally truncated UFO versions lacking the F-box domain (UFOΔFbox and UFOΔFbox–VP16) activated _pAP3_ similarly to the full-length (FL) UFO (Fig. 1e).
The connection of UFO to an SCF complex thus appears dispensable for _pAP3_ activation in transient protoplast assays.
The previously reported inactivity of UFO with an internal deletion of its F-box probably reflects the poor folding of this protein variant rather than the functional importance of the F-box domain (Extended Data Fig.
1a–c)
[20] .
We also constitutively expressed tagged versions of UFO and UFOΔFbox in _Arabidopsis_ .
Irrespective of the presence of the F-box, plants displaying a detectable UFO or UFOΔFbox expression (Extended Data Fig. 1d) showed a typical UFO gain-of-function phenotype (Fig.
1f,g).
In addition, both UFO versions complemented the strong _ufo-1_ mutant and induced gain-of-function phenotypes (Fig.
1h and Extended Data Fig.
1e,f)
[8] .
Still, minor defects (such as some missing or misshapen petals and disorganized flowers) were specifically observed in the absence of the F-box, suggesting that this conserved domain might be important for a subset of UFO functions (Fig.
1h and Extended Data Fig.
1g).
Overall, UFO and UFOΔFbox have very similar activities, showing that the role of the F-box domain is largely dispensable    and that a ubiquitination-independent mechanism determines the LFY–UFO synergy.
**LFY and UFO form a transcriptional complex on a** **new DNA motif**
Protoplast assays established that the _AP3_ and _
RBE_ promoter sequences contain the information that dictates their specific activation by LFY–UFO.
Several regulatory regions driving _AP3_ regulation in early floral meristem have been identified, including the distal and proximal early elements (DEE and PEE; Fig.
2a)
[23][,][24] .
The DEE contains a predicted canonical LFYBS, but in protoplasts, like in plants [24], this site is not sufficient to explain _pAP3_ activation (Extended Data Fig. 2).
By systematically testing _AP3_ promoter variants in the transient assay, we identified a 20-base-pair (bp) DNA element around the PEE important for LFY–UFO-dependent activation but devoid of canonical LFYBS (Fig.
2b and Extended Data Fig.
3a–c).
We investigated the possibility that LFY and UFO form a complex on this DNA element using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs).
For this, we mixed either recombinant LFY-DBD (the LFY domain interacting with UFO)
[18] or in-vitro-produced FL LFY with a reconstituted ASK1–UFO complex.
None of the proteins bound the DNA probe alone, but a shift was observed when LFY–DBD or FL LFY was mixed with ASK1–UFO  (Fig. 2c).
Thus, a presumptive ASK1–UFO–LFY complex was formed on a _pAP3_ DNA element (hereafter named LFY–UFO Binding Site 0 (LUBS0)) that each partner did not bind on its own.
We did note that UFO had a weak affinity for DNA, as ASK1–UFO shifted the DNA probe when we performed EMSAs with low competitor DNA concentrations (Extended Data Fig.
3d).
EMSAs performed with LUBS0 mutated at various bases provided evidence that the formation of the complex is sequence-specific and suggests a bipartite DNA motif (Extended Data Fig.
3f).
To identify all genome regions possibly targeted by the ASK1– UFO–LFY complex, we performed amplified DNA affinity purification sequencing (ampDAP-seq) with a reconstituted ASK1–UFO–LFY complex (Extended Data Fig.
4a,b).
We identified numerous genomic regions where LFY binding was strongly enhanced by the presence of ASK1–UFO.
For each bound region, we computed the ratio (the coverage fold change (CFC)) between the coverage of peaks in the presence or absence of ASK1–UFO (Fig. 2d).
Searches for enriched DNA motifs in the 600 regions with the highest CFC (>4.7) identified two bipartite motifs made of a 6-bp RRNRCA (N indicates A/C/G/T; R indicates A/G) sequence, four bases of variable sequence and either a monomeric or a dimeric site resembling canonical LFYBS but with more variability (Fig. 2e).
Consistent with the presence of a sequence resembling LFYBS, we found that _pAP3_ activation in protoplasts required the LFY amino acid residues involved in binding to canonical LFYBS (Extended Data Fig.
4c,d).
We named the identified motifs mLUBS and dLUBS for monomeric  and dimeric LFY–UFO Binding Sites, respectively (Fig. 2e).
Since it is observed specifically with ASK1–UFO, the RRNRCA element was named the UFO Recruiting Motif (URM).
Position weight matrices (PWMs) for dLUBS and to a lesser extent mLUBS outperformed the canonical PWM for LFY, showing that they reliably predicted the binding of ASK1–UFO–LFY (Extended Data Fig. 4e).
The LFYBS present within the LUBS of high-CFC regions tended to have a lower predicted affinity than those present in regions bound by LFY alone (Extended Data Fig. 4f), explaining why LFY binding to those sequences occurs only with UFO and the URM.
Remarkably, we also identified the URM de novo from published LFY chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data (Extended Data Fig.
4g)
[25] .
Moreover, we found that the LFY ChIP-seq performed in inflorescences [25] correlates better with the ASK1–UFO–LFY ampDAP-seq than with the LFY ampDAP-seq (Spearman rank correlation of 0.481 versus 0.338 for the first 1,000 ChIP-seq peaks), strongly suggesting that many regions are bound in vivo by UFO (see examples of such regions in Extended Data Fig.
7b,c).

We observed a complex of slower mobility with dLUBS than with mLUBS, consistent with the presence of two LFY molecules on dLUBS.
ASK1–UFO also supershifted LFY bound to canonical LFYBS from _pAP1_ and _pAP3_ DEE (Extended Data Fig. 4i), sometimes (but not systematically) increasing apparent LFY binding.
**LUBS are functional regulatory elements** Examination of the _pAP3_ genomic region in ASK1–UFO–LFY ampDAP-seq revealed a peak that is absent in the experiment performed with LFY alone (Fig. 3a).

We searched for LUBS under this peak, and, to our surprise, we identified several sites predicted to be better than LUBS0 (Fig. 3a).
In EMSAs, the two highest-scoring sites, LUBS1 and LUBS2, were specifically bound by LFY in the presence of ASK1–UFO (Fig.
3b and Extended Data Fig. 5a).
EMSAs performed with a LFY mutant version affected in its ability to dimerize further confirmed the stoichiometry of LFY–UFO complexes on LUBS1 and LUBS2 (Extended Data Fig. 5b).
A similar binding was also observed when combining LFY and UFO∆Fbox (Extended Data Fig.
5c,d), consistent with the F-box being facultative for LFY–UFO transcriptional activity (Fig. 1).
In the protoplast assay, altering LUBS1 or LUBS2 (or both) significantly reduced _pAP3_ activation (Fig. 3c); the LUBS1 alteration had a stronger    [Nature Plants | Volume 9 | February](http://www.nature.com/natureplants) 2023

Specifically altering the URM of _pAP3_ LUBS1 and LUBS2, which abolished LFY–UFO binding on individual sites in EMSAs (Extended Data Fig. 5e), also reduced _pAP3_ activation, albeit less effectively than altering the whole LUBS (Extended Data Fig.
5f).
Finally, the previously described _pAP3_ :: _GUS_ staining pattern in the second and third whorls of early floral meristems in _Arabidopsis_ was severely reduced when LUBS1 and LUBS2 were altered, demonstrating the importance of these sites in vivo (Fig.
3d and Extended Data Fig.
5g).
Similarly, the _RBE_ promoter contains an ASK1–UFO–LFY ampDAP-seq peak that is absent with LFY alone (Extended Data Fig. 6a), and the functional importance of the single LUBS identified under this peak was confirmed using EMSAs, transient assays in protoplasts and stable reporter constructs in plants (Extended Data Fig.
6b–e).
In addition to _AP3_ and _RBE_, LFY and UFO together probably regulate many other genes in _Arabidopsis_ .
To identify such potential LFY–UFO targets, we established a list of genes bound (in ampDAP and ChIP) and regulated by LFY–UFO (Extended Data Fig. 7a).
This procedure identified the other B gene _PISTILLATA_ ( _PI_ ), previously proposed as a LFY–UFO target but through an unknown regulatory element that the LUBS model precisely localized (Extended Data Fig. 7b).

**The LFY K249R substitution specifically affects** **UFO-dependent LFY functions**
In _Arabidopsis_, LFY performs UFO-dependent and independent functions
[3], and we wondered whether they could be uncoupled by introducing specific alterations in LFY.
As we were initially looking for LFY ubiquitination mutants, we substituted exposed lysines of LFY–DBD with arginines and tested the effect of such alterations on LFY–UFO-dependent _pAP3_ activation in protoplasts.
We found one substitution (LFY K249R; Extended Data Fig.
8a) that strongly reduced _pAP3_ activation by LFY–UFO (Fig. 4a) or LFY–VP16–UFO (Extended Data Fig.
8b)
without affecting the UFO-independent _pAG_ activation (Extended Data Fig.
8c) or the LFY–UFO interaction (Extended Data Fig. 8d).
AmpDAP-seq experiments showed that the LFY K249R substitution specifically impaired the binding of LFY–UFO but not that of LFY alone (Fig. 4b,c and Extended Data Fig.
8e–i), revealing that Lys249 plays a key role in LFY–UFO interaction with the LUBS DNA.
The importance of LFY Lys249 for UFO-dependent LFY functions was also confirmed using complementation assays of the _Arabidopsis_

A structure at a 4.27 Å resolution was obtained (Extended Data Fig.

Due to the modest resolution, specific interacting amino acids could not be unambiguously identified.
However, the major protein– protein and protein–DNA interaction surfaces were clearly identifiable.
The structure revealed that UFO directly contacts the DNA in the major groove around the URM (Fig. 5c).
This binding probably involves basic residues present on loops projecting from the UFO Kelch-type β-propeller and results in a bend of roughly 30 degrees in the DNA double helix (Extended Data Fig. 9f).
The structure also shows an interface between UFO and one LFY–DBD monomer (Fig. 5c).
The LFY–DBD loop containing the Lys249 residue lies in this interface and probably interacts with one of the DNA-binding loops of UFO, consistent with the key role of LFY Lys249 in the ternary complex formation.

These data show how a β-propeller protein is able to modify the specificity of a TF, and they offer a structural explanation of how LFY and UFO synergistically recognize a specific DNA element via direct interactions by both proteins with the DNA.
**The LFY–UFO complex might have a deep** **evolutionary origin**
As genetic and physical LFY–UFO interactions have been described in diverse angiosperms, we wondered whether the mechanism unravelled for _Arabidopsis_ proteins could also apply to LFY from other species, including non-angiosperm ones.
We selected LFY orthologous proteins from several species and with different DNA binding specificities (Fig. 6a).
LFY specificity has evolved with three major DNA binding specificities [30] .
Type I specificity is the one described in _Arabidopsis_ and is valid for other angiosperms, gymnosperms, ferns and the moss _Marchantia polymorpha_, with two half-sites separated by a 3-bp spacer (Fig. 2e).
LFY from the moss _
Physcomitrium patens_ has a type II

**c**, Zoom on the   specificity with specific half-sites (different from type I half-sites) also separated by a 3-bp spacer.
Finally, type III specificity is found for LFY from algae and corresponds to a type II motif without the spacer.
Because functional UFO homologues have not been identified outside angiosperms, we used _Arabidopsis_ UFO (AtUFO) in all the following experiments.
We tested the interactions of various LFY orthologues with AtUFO in yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) (Fig. 6b), in DLRAs in protoplasts with _Arabidopsis_ _
pAP3_ (Fig. 6c) and in EMSAs (Fig. 6d).
In Y2H, all LFYs except LFY from _P. patens_ (type II) interacted with AtUFO (Fig. 6b).
However, only type I LFYs from angiosperms, gymnosperms and ferns formed a complex on _pAP3_ LUBS and activated _pAP3_ in the protoplast assay (Fig.
6c,d).
These results suggest that the ability of LFY and UFO to act together by forming a complex is ancient, largely predating the origin of angiosperms.
We obtained no evidence that type II and III LFYs (from moss and algae) could form a complex with AtUFO on LUBS1 and LUBS2.
A detailed and more trustworthy history of the LFY–UFO interaction will await further analyses, notably with the identification of UFO orthologues from non-angiosperm genomes.
**Discussion**  LFY has long been known to interact with UFO to control flower and inflorescence development in numerous angiosperm species.
However, the molecular nature of their synergistic action remained unknown.
As UFO encodes an F-box protein taking part in an SCF complex [17][,][31][,][32], it was thought to target proteins for SCF [UFO] -dependent ubiquitination    UFO–DNA contact region (left) and on the LFY–UFO interface (right).
Only the high-information CA of the URM and its complement are highlighted by filled colouring the rings for each base (red for A, blue for T, pale green for G and purple for C).
The LFY–DBD loop containing the Lys249 residue is highlighted in dark blue.
**d**, Zoom on the ASK1–UFO interface, with the UFO F-box highlighted in gold.
Source data are available in Supplementary Data 4.   and possible degradation.
LFY was an obvious target candidate, but clear evidence of LFY ubiquitination was missing [12][,][18] .
The results we present here suggest that the F-box domain, required for ubiquitination, is dispensable for most UFO-dependent LFY activity.
Nevertheless, the high conservation level of the UFO F-box sequence in angiosperms, together with slight differences in UFO activity when the F-box is deleted, suggests that this domain might still be needed for some elusive facets of UFO function.
UFO may work redundantly with other F-box proteins in ubiquitination pathways, such as the F-box protein HAWAIIAN SKIRT identified in a genetic screen as an enhancer of the _ufo_ mutant phenotype
[33] .
It is thus possible that UFO acts as a moonlighting protein
[34] with functions in both transcription and ubiquitination, and these two activities could be related or independent.
The molecular mechanism we discovered here is consistent with most published data on _AP3_ and _PI_ regulation [18][,][23][,][35][,][36] .
However, a detailed understanding of the expression patterns of _AP3_ and _RBE_ will require further work on other _cis_ - and _trans_ - elements.
Why _AP3_ is not transcribed in floral stage 0–1 despite the expression of LFY and UFO is unclear [20] .
It could be because SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION  OF CO 1 (SOC1), AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 (AGL24) and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) act as early _AP3_ repressors, as _AP3_ mRNA is detected in the floral anlage in a _soc1_ _svp_ _
agl24_ mutant
[37][,][38] .
Another explanation could be that _AP3_ expression requires the _SEPALLATA3_ activator
[39] .
Why _pAP3_ is not activated by LFY (or LFY–VP16) alone through the canonical LFYBS is also an open question.

One-way ANOVAs were performed with data from the same effector (one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests for 3xHA–LFY* + EV data and Welch’s ANOVA with Games– Howell post hoc tests for 3xHA–LFY* + UFO–VP16–3xFLAG data).

but in the absence of direct evidence that a LFY–UFO complex forms on new binding sites, it was difficult to understand how UFO controls only a subset of LFY targets.
These new regulatory sites (mLUBS and dLUBS) are made of a low-affinity or half LFYBS (poorly or not bound    [Nature Plants | Volume 9 | February](http://www.nature.com/natureplants) 2023
| 315–329 **322**   **Article** https://doi.org/10.1038/s41477-022-01336-2    by LFY alone) and a motif located at a fixed distance from it and responsible for UFO recruitment.
The formation of such a sequence-specific complex is explained at the structural level by the capacity of UFO to interact with both LFY and DNA.
The poor ability of UFO to bind DNA alone explains its complete dependence on LFY to perform its transcriptional functions in planta [6][,][20] .
Thus, depending on the _cis_ -elements present in regulatory regions, LFY either binds DNA as a homodimer or requires UFO to form a ternary complex.
The alteration of the LFY Lys249 residue allows these two types of binding to be uncoupled by specifically disrupting the formation of the LFY–UFO–DNA complex.
The position of this residue in the three-dimensional structure at the interface among LFY, UFO and DNA is consistent with the key role of this residue in the complex formation.
It is possible that replacing Lys249 with a bulkier Arg residue displaces the UFO loops involved in DNA binding without affecting the LFY–UFO interaction.
Obtaining a higher-resolution structure will help us precisely understand the interactions occurring in this complex.
Although it might be a common regulatory mechanism, only a few cases where non-TF proteins modify TF DNA binding specificity have been described so far (for example, Met4 and Met28 modifying the bind                                                   ing of TF Cbf1 in yeast [40], or the herpes simplex virus transcriptional acti vator VP16 changing the specificity of the Oct-1/HCF-1 complex [41] ).
None of these examples involves an F-box protein or a Kelch-type β-propeller protein, and none has been characterized at the structural level.
The modification of TF DNA binding specificity by non-TF proteins offers additional possibilities for the combinatorial control of gene expression and explains how a master regulator such as LFY accesses specific _cis_ -elements to perform different functions in distinct territories.
Since LFY and UFO play key roles together in numerous plant species (including ornamental, crop and model plants), our findings expand the molecular understanding of flower and inflorescence development in a large variety of angiosperms.
Because the LFY–UFO synergy is observed with LFY orthologues from gymnosperms and ferns as well, we speculate that this complex largely predated the origin of flowers and could have been co-opted for flower development from a yet-unknown ancestral role.
**Methods** _**Arabidopsis**_ **growth** All mutants and transgenic lines are in the _A. thaliana_ Columbia-0 (Col-0) accession.
Seeds were sown on soil, stratified for three days at 4 °C and then grown at 22 °C under long-day conditions (16 h light).
Transgenic plants were obtained with _Agrobacterium tumefaciens_ C58C1
pMP90 using the floral dip method.
Transformants were identified using GFP or Basta selection.
_**Arabidopsis**_ **cell suspension culture** _
Arabidopsis thaliana_ (ecotype Col-0) cells in suspension cultures were grown under continuous light (90 μmol of photons per m [2] per s) at 21 °C with shaking in Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 30 g l
[−1] sucrose and 2 mg l
[−1] 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, pH 5.5.
The suspension cells were subcultured every week with a fivefold dilution.
Suspension cells at four or five days following subculture were used for protoplast preparation.
**Cloning** DNA fragments were amplified by PCR with Phusion high-fidelity polymerase (NEB).
Plasmids were all obtained by Gibson Assembly with either PCR-amplified or restriction-enzyme-digested backbone vectors.
We used the 420-amino-acid LFY version.
For site-directed  mutagenesis, primers containing the desired mutations were used for Gibson Assembly mutagenesis.
Plasmids were obtained using DH5α bacteria and were all verified by Sanger sequencing.
A list of plasmids and cloning procedures is provided in Supplementary Data 1.
The oligonucleotide sequences are listed in Supplementary Data 2.
**Y2H**
The coding sequences were cloned in pGADT7-AD or pGBKT7 vectors (Clontech) by Gibson Assembly.
Y187 and AH109 yeast strains (Clontech) were transformed with pGADT7-AD or pGBKT7 vectors and selected on plates lacking leucine (SD −L) or tryptophan (SD −W), respectively (MP Biomedicals).
After mating, the yeasts were restreaked on plates lacking leucine and tryptophan (SD −L−W) for two days.
The yeasts were then resuspended in sterile water, and OD 600nm was adjusted to the indicated values for all constructions; two tenfold dilutions were performed, and 6 μl drops were done on SD −L−W or SD
−L−W−A−H
(lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine and adenine) plates.
The yeasts were grown at 28 °C, and pictures were taken at the indicated times.
**DLRAs in** _**Arabidopsis**_ **protoplasts** Effector plasmids with a 3xHA tag were obtained by cloning the indicated genes in the modified pRT104 vector containing a 3xHA N-terminal tag (pRT104–3xHA)
[42] .
The pRT104 empty plasmid was reengineered to insert a 3xFLAG C-terminal tag.
For reporter plasmids, the indicated promoter fragments were cloned upstream of a firefly luciferase gene in pBB174 (ref.
[43] ).
We used a 975-bp _pAP3_ fragment and a 2-kilobase (kb) _pRBE_ promoter fragment upstream of the ATG, known to induce a WT pattern in planta [23][,][44] .
_pAG_ corresponds to the _AG_ second intron fused to a minimal _35S_ promoter, known to induce a WT pattern in planta [22] .
For _pAP1_, we used a 600-bp fragment upstream of the ATG.
This version is sufficient to give a WT pattern in planta [45], and the use of longer promoter versions induced a very high background noise in protoplasts.
The pRLC reference plasmid contains a _Renilla_ luciferase sequence under the control of the _35S_ promoter.
Plasmids were obtained in large amounts using a NucleoBond Xtra Maxi Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel).
Protoplasts were prepared from _Arabidopsis_ Col-0 cell suspension and transformed following the procedure described by Iwata et al.
[46] .
The cell walls were digested using Onuzuka R-10 cellulase and macerozyme R-10 (Yakult Pharmaceutical).
The digested cells were passed through two layers of Miracloth to remove debris, and the protoplast concentration was adjusted to 2–5 × 10
[5] cells per ml.
The protoplasts were then PEG-mediated transformed using 10 μg of the indicated effector and reporter plasmids and 2 μg of the reference plasmid.
After 17 h of incubation at room temperature, the protoplasts were lysed.
Firefly (F-LUC) and _Renilla_ luciferase (R-LUC) activities were measured using a Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and a TECAN Spark 10 M 96-well plate reader.
F-LUC/R-LUC luminescence ratios were calculated with background-corrected values.
Four biological replicates were done for each plasmid combination.
**EMSAs**
The DNA probes used in EMSAs are listed in Supplementary Data 2.
Complementary oligonucleotides were annealed overnight in annealing buffer (10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA).
Then, 4 pmol of double-stranded DNA was fluorescently labelled with 1 unit of Klenow fragment polymerase (NEB) and 8 pmol of Cy5-dCTP (Cytiva) in Klenow buffer for 1 h at 37 °C.
The enzymatic reaction was stopped with a 10 min incubation at 65 °C.
The proteins used in EMSAs were obtained by different methods (bacteria, insect cells or quick coupled transcription/translation (TnT)).
The concentrations of recombinant proteins (6xHis–LFY–DBD and UFOΔFbox–3xFLAG) and recombinant complexes (ASK1–UFO and ASK1–UFO–3xFLAG) were adjusted to 500 nM for all reactions.
All the 5xmyc-tagged proteins were obtained in vitro by TnT.
We did 50 µl TnT reactions by mixing 5 µg of pTNT–5xmyc plasmid containing the gene of interest with TnT SP6 High-Yield Wheat Germ Protein Expression System (Promega) for 2 h at 25 °C.
For EMSAs with TnT-produced proteins, 5 µl of TnT reaction was used.
Recombinant protein buffer or TnT mix was used as a control when comparing reactions with multiple proteins.
All binding reactions were performed in 20 µl of binding buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, 0.25 mM EDTA, 2 mM

The reactions were supplemented with 140 ng µl
[−1] fish sperm DNA (Sigma-Aldrich) for EMSAs performed with in-vitro-produced LFY and 200 ng µl
[−1] for EMSAs performed with recombinant 6xHis–LFY–DBD.
The binding reactions were incubated for 20 min on ice and then loaded on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel.
The gels were electrophoresed at 90 V for 75 min at 4 °C and revealed with an Amersham ImageQuant 800 imager (Cytiva).
The uncropped gels are shown in the Source data.
**Recombinant protein production and purification from** **bacteria**
We produced 6xHis–LFY–DBD in _E. coli_ Rosetta2 (DE3) cells (Novagen) and purified it as previously described [29] .
ASK1 was cloned into the pETM-11 expression vector [47], and the resulting plasmid was transformed into _
E. coli_ BL21 cells (Novagen).
The bacteria were grown in LB medium supplemented with kanamycin and chloramphenicol at 37 °C up to an OD 600nm of 0.6.
The cells were then shifted to 18 °C, and 0.4 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added.
After an overnight incubation, the cells were sonicated in UFO buffer (25 mM Tris (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM TCEP) supplemented with one EDTA-free Pierce Protease Inhibitor Tablet (Thermo Fisher).
The lysed cells were then centrifuged for 30 min at 27,000 _g_ .
The supernatant was mixed with Ni Sepharose High Performance resin (Cytiva) previously equilibrated with UFO buffer (25 mM Tris (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM TCEP).
The resin was then washed with UFO buffer containing 20 and 40 mM imidazole.
Bound proteins were eluted with UFO buffer containing 300 mM imidazole and dialysed overnight at 4 °C against UFO buffer without imidazole.

The different tagged versions of ASK1, LFY and UFO were cloned in acceptor and donor plasmids (pACEBac1, pIDK and pIDS, respectively; Geneva Biotech).
The final acceptor plasmids containing the desired combination of coding sequences were obtained with Cre recombinase (NEB).
DH10EmBacY-competent cells containing the baculovirus genomic DNA (bacmid) were transformed with the final acceptor plasmids.
Blue-white selection was used to identify colonies with a recombinant bacmid with the acceptor plasmid inserted.
Bacmid was then isolated from bacteria and mixed with X-tremeGENE HP DNA  Transfection Reagent (Roche) to transfect Sf21 insect cells.
At 96 h after transfection, supernatant containing the recombinant baculovirus (V0) was collected and used to infect fresh Sf21 cells.
When the infected cells reached the day post arrest, V1 virus was collected.
For large expression, Sf21 cells were infected with either V1 virus or frozen baculovirus-infected cells.
The pellet of a 0.75 l culture was sonicated in 50 ml of UFO buffer supplemented with one EDTA-free Pierce Protease Inhibitor Tablet (Thermo Fisher).
The sonicated cells were centrifuged for 1.5 h at 120,000 _g_ at 4 °C.
The supernatant was then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with Ni Sepharose High Performance resin (Cytiva) previously equilibrated with UFO buffer.
The beads were transferred into a column and washed with 20 column volumes of UFO buffer, then UFO buffer + 50 mM imidazole.
Proteins were eluted with UFO buffer con taining 300 mM imidazole.
The elution was dialysed overnight at 4 °C against UFO buffer.
TEV protease was added to cleave tags (0.01% w/w).
When ASK1 was limiting compared with UFO, recombinant 6xHis–ASK1 from bacteria was added.
The following day, the elution was repassed on Dextrin Sepharose High Performance (Cytiva) and Ni Sepharose High Performance resins (Cytiva) to remove tags and contaminants.
For ASK1–UFO, ASK1–UFO–3xFLAG or UFOΔFbox–3xFLAG, the proteins were concentrated with a 30 kDa Amicon Ultra Centrifugal filter (Millipore) and further purified by SEC.
For ASK1–UFO–LFY–DBD complex purification, contaminant DNA was removed by passing proteins on Q Sepharose High Performance resin (Cytiva) pre-equilibrated with UFO buffer.
Increasing salt concentrations allowed us to obtain    DNA-free proteins.
The indicated annealed HPLC-purified oligonucleotides (Supplementary Data 2) were then added and incubated with proteins on ice for 20 min.
The proteins were concentrated with a 30 kDa Amicon Ultra Centrifugal filter (Millipore) and further purified by SEC.
**SEC and SEC–MALLS**  SEC was performed with a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva) equilibrated with UFO buffer.
Unaggregated proteins of interest were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.
SEC–MALLS was performed with a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva) equilibrated with UFO buffer.
For each run, 50 µl containing 1 mg ml
[−1] of complex was injected.
Separations were performed at room temperature with a flow rate of 0.5 ml min [−1] .
The elutions were monitored by using a Dawn Heleos II for MALLS measurement (Wyatt Technology) and an Optilab T-rEX refractometer for refractive index measurements (Wyatt Technology).
Molecular mass calculations were performed using ASTRA software with a refractive index increment (dn/dc) of 0.185 ml g
[−1] .
**ampDAP-seq**
We used pTnT–5xmyc–LFY [48] to produce 5xmyc–LFY in vitro using a TnT SP6 High-Yield Wheat Germ Protein Expression System (Promega).
We used the ampDAP-seq libraries described in Lai et al.
[48] .
The ampDAP-seq experiments were performed in triplicates (LFY–UFO) or in duplicates (LFY [K249R] and LFY [K249R] –UFO).
A 50 µl TnT reaction producing 5xmyc–LFY was mixed with an excess of recombinant ASK1–UFO–3xFLAG (2 µg) and 20 µl of Pierce Anti-c-Myc Magnetic Beads (ThermoScientific).
DAP buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP and 0.005% NP40) was added to reach 200 µl.
The mix was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel.
The beads were then immobilized and washed three times with  100 µl of DAP buffer, moved to a new tube and washed once again.
The ampDAP-seq input libraries (50 ng) were then added, and protein–DNA mixes were incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel.
The beads were immobilized and washed five times with 100 µl of DAP buffer, moved to a new tube and washed two more times.
Finally, the beads were mixed with 30 µl of elution buffer (10 mM Tris (pH 8.5)) and heated for 10 min at 90 °C.
Immunoprecipitated DNA fragments contained in the elution were amplified by PCR according to the published protocol [49] with Illumina TruSeq primers.
The remaining beads were mixed with 20 µl of 1× SDS–PAGE Protein Sample Buffer, and western blots were performed to check the presence of tagged proteins.
The PCR products were purified using AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Library molar concentrations were determined by quantitative PCR using a NEBNext Library Quant Kit for Illumina (NEB).
The libraries were then pooled with equal molarity.
Sequencing was done on Illumina HiSeq (Genewiz) with the specification of paired-end sequencing of 150 cycles.
**GUS staining**
The different promoter versions were cloned upstream of the _GUS_ gene in the pRB14 backbone vector [45] .
Transformants were selected with GFP seed fluorescence.
The number of independent lines analysed for each construct is indicated in each figure.
GUS staining was performed on the apex of primary inflorescences of T 2 plants.
Tissues were placed in ice-cold 90% acetone for 20 min at room temperature and then rinsed in GUS buffer without X-Gluc (0.2% Triton X-100, 50 mM NaPO 4 (pH 7.2), 2 mM potassium ferrocyanide and 2 mM potassium ferricyanide).
The tissues were transferred to GUS buffer containing 2 mM X-Gluc substrate (X-Gluc DIRECT) and placed under vacuum for 5 min.
The samples were then incubated overnight at 37 °C unless otherwise specified in the legend.
Finally, the tissues were washed with different ethanol solutions (35%, 50% and 70%), and pictures were taken with a Keyence VHX-5000 microscope with a VH-Z100R objective.
[Nature Plants | Volume 9 | February](http://www.nature.com/natureplants) 2023 | 315–329 **324**   **Article** https://doi.org/10.1038/s41477-022-01336-2    **In planta overexpression and mutant complementation assays** Tagged versions of UFO and UFOΔFbox were cloned under the control of the _35S_ promoter in pEGAD
[50] .
Transformants were selected with Basta treatment.
Overexpressing lines with a strong gain-of-function phenotype were crossed with the strong _ufo-1_ mutant.
Basta-resistant F 2 plants were individually genotyped to select _ufo-1_ −/− homozygous plants.
For this, a fragment was amplified by PCR with the oligonucleotides oGT1085 and oPR578 (Supplementary Data 2) and digested with DpnII enzyme (NEB).
On the basis of the digestion profile, _ufo-1_ −/− plants were kept and analysed once they reached flowering.
Altered versions of LFY were cloned in pETH29 (ref.
[29] ) or pCA26 (ref.
[51] ) to express LFY complementary DNA under the control of its endogenous promoter or the _35S_ promoter, respectively.
For the                                                     _lfy-12_ complementation assay, heterozygous _lfy-12/+_ plants were trans formed.
The transformants were selected with GFP fluorescence and genotyped with a previously described protocol [45] to select _lfy-12_ −/− plants.
The complementation assay was performed with T 2 plants and was based on the analysis of the first ten flowers from the primary inflorescence.
Pictures were taken with a Keyence VHX-5000 microscope with a VH-Z20R objective.
**Western blots**  For western blots on plant total protein extracts, the indicated tissues were crushed in 2× SDS–PAGE Protein Sample Buffer (100 mM Tris (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.005% Bromophenol blue and 0.8% w/v dithiothreitol) at a 1:2 w/v ratio and boiled for 5 min.
The samples were then loaded on a 12% acrylamide SDS–PAGE gel.
For all western blots, transfer was performed with an iBlot2 Dry Blotting System (Invitrogen) using the default parameters.
Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% milk TBST and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5% milk TBST solution containing HRP-conjugated antibody (1:1,000 for anti-FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich; Cat.
No. A8592)
and 1:5,000 for anti-myc (Invitrogen; Cat.
No. R951-25)).
Revelation was performed with Clarity Western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad).
Pictures were taken with a ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (BioRad).
The uncropped gels are shown in the Source data.
**Cryo-EM sample preparation, data collection and data** **processing**
An aliquot of the SEC-purified ASK1–UFO–LFY–LUBS1 complex was thawed on ice (see Supplementary Data 2 for the LUBS1 DNA sequence).
Subsequently, 3.5 μl of the complex at 1 mg ml
[−1] was deposited onto glow-discharged (25 mA, 30 s) C-flat Au grid R 1.2/1.3 300 mesh (Electron Microscopy Sciences), blotted for 5.5 s with force 0 at 20 °C and 100% humidity using a Mark IV Vitrobot (FEI, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane for specimen vitrification.
A dataset of about 1,000 videos of 40 frames was acquired on a 200 kV Glacios (Thermo Fisher Scientific) electron microscope (Supplementary Data 3) at a nominal magnification of 36,000 with a physical pixel size of 1.145 Å.  The raw videos, acquired with SerialEM on a Gatan K2 Summit camera (Supplementary Data 3), were imported to Cryosparc live [52] for motion correction and CTF estimation.
The dose-weighted micrographs were used for particle picking with crYOLO v.1.7.6 and the general model for low-pass filtered images [53] .
Particle coordinates were imported to Cryosparc, where all subsequent steps were performed.
After manual inspection, a subset of 761 micrographs was selected on the basis of CTF fit resolution, total and per-frame motion, average defocus and relative ice thickness.
A raw particle stack of 282,567 images was extracted at a box size of 256 × 256 pixels [2], binned twice and subjected to two-dimensional classification to remove false positive picks.
A total of 207,392 particles from the selected class averages were re-extracted, re-centred at full size and submitted for a second round of two-dimensional classification.
All class averages showing clear protein features were selected, and the resulting 147,849 particles were used    for ab initio reconstruction with three classes and subsequent heterogeneous refinement of the resulting volumes.
Of those three classes, two looked like a protein–DNA complex, with the most apparent difference being the presence or absence of an extra electron density at one edge of the DNA helix.
The last class had no recognizable features and was used as a decoy to remove ‘junk’ particles.
Each subset and volume of the two first classes was refined separately with non-uniform refinement
[54], resulting in two distinct reconstructions of about 4.2 Å resolution, where the DNA model, the crystal structure of LFY–DBD and the AlphaFold2 models of UFO and ASK1 could be unambiguously fitted into the electron density.
The second of these classes could fit a LFY–DBD dimer, while in the first class there was density only for the LFY–DBD molecule that directly interacts with UFO (Extended Data Fig. 9d).
The unsharpened maps of each reconstruction were used for post-processing with DeepEMhancer [55] .
The figures were prepared with Chimera [56] or ChimeraX [57] .
**Cryo-EM model building** Ideal B-form DNA was generated in Coot
[58] and then manually built into the electron density.
The resulting model was further refined using phenix.real_space_refine [59] .
A single monomer of LFY–DBD was manually placed in the electron density, followed by fitting in ChimeraX
[57] .
The biological LFY–DBD dimer was then downloaded from the RCSB
[PDB (2VY1)](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb2VY1/pdb)
[29] and used as a guide to place the second LFY monomer, followed by fitting to density in ChimeraX.
Alphafold models
[60] of ASK1 [(uniprot ID: Q39255) and UFO (uniprot ID: Q39090) were both down-](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q39255) loaded from the EBI, preprocessed to remove low-confidence regions in phenix.process_predicted_model [61], and then placed manually and fit to density in ChimeraX.   **Bioinformatic analyses** **Read mapping and peak calling.
**
Read processing and peak calling of LFY, LFY–UFO, LFY [K249R] and LFY [K249R] –UFO ampDAP-seq data were performed as previously published [62] .
Briefly, the quality of sequencing data was analysed with fastQC v.0.11.7, and adapters were removed with NGmerge v.0.2_dev [63] .
Bowtie2 v.2.3.4.1 was used for mapping to the TAIR10 _A. thaliana_ reference genome [64] .
Reads mapped to a single location and with a maximum of two mismatches were retained.
Duplicates were removed with the samtools dedup program v.1.8.
Bound regions (that is, peaks) were identified with MACS2 v.2.2.7.1, using input DNA from Lai et al. as a control [48] .
Consensus peaks were selected with MSPC v.4.0.0 (ref.
[65] ) by retaining peaks called in all replicates and resizing them by ±200 bp around the peak maximum for further analysis.
**Analyses of ampDAP-seq experiments.
**
To compare binding in different experiments, peaks were merged according to a previously published procedure [62] .
Bound peaks were considered as common if they overlapped by at least 80%, while the remaining non-overlapping portion of either peak was <50%.
Peaks that did not overlap by at least 50% were considered as new peaks.
The same procedure was used to assess experimental reproducibility (comparisons between replicates of the same experiment), where peaks were normalized by the number of reads mapped in the library (RPKM).
As the fraction of reads mapped in peaks is much lower for LFY than LFY–UFO ampDAP-seq (~25% versus ~40%, respectively), normalizing the read count by all reads mapped along the genome would introduce a bias and estimate the LFY relative coverage (RPKM) towards lower values compared with LFY–UFO.
In addition to this consideration, experimental proof from EMSAs suggests that UFO does not strongly affect the binding intensity of the complex at canonical LFYBS (which represent most peaks).
Hence, the read count at each peak was normalized by the total number of reads mapped within all LFY and LFY–UFO merged peaks.
Then, the mean normalized coverage from each experiment, divided by the peak size, was computed for each peak.
The same strategy was applied when comparing LFY [K249R]
[Nature Plants | Volume 9 | February](http://www.nature.com/natureplants) 2023 | 315–329 **325**   **Article** https://doi.org/10.1038/s41477-022-01336-2    and LFY [K249R] –UFO (Fig. 4b), LFY [K249R] and LFY (Extended Data Fig.
8h), and LFY, LFY–UFO, LFY [K249R] and LFY [K249R] –UFO (Fig. 4c).
The CFC was computed on merged peaks as the ratio between the mean normalized peak coverage in LFY–UFO and LFY (Fig. 2d) or the mean normalized coverage in LFY [K249R] –UFO and LFY [K249R] (Fig. 4b).
**Motif search in bound regions.
** Merged peaks of the LFY and LFY–UFO datasets were sorted on the basis of decreasing CFC value.
The top 600 peaks (that is, the highest CFC values) were used for a motif search using MEME-ChIP v.4.12.0 using the options nmeme, 600; meme-maxsize, 600*1000; meme-nmotifs, 1; dreme-m, 0; and noecho and the JASPAR 2018 core plants non-redundant database [66] .
For dLUBS, we used the options meme-minw, 20; meme-maxw, 30; while for mLUBS, we used meme-minw, 16; meme-maxw, 19.
To retrieve the LFY motif in Fig. 2e, the 600 LFY ampDAP-seq peaks with the strongest coverage were fed to MEME-ChIP with the options nmeme, 600; meme-nmotifs, 1; meme-minw, 19; meme-maxw, 19; pal.
**Receiver operating characteristics analysis.
**
From the dataset of merged peak sets (peaks found in LFY or in LFY–UFO experiments or in both), the peaks were sorted on the basis of decreased CFC value, the top 20% peaks were selected, and among these, the first 600 used for motif determination were excluded to avoid overfitting, for a total of 3,243 final peaks.
A negative set of the same size was created using a previously published method, which allows searching for sequences from the _A. thaliana_ genome (TAIR10 reference) with the same GC content and genomic origin as the positive set [67] .
Both sets were scanned with dLUBS and mLUBS PWMs as well as with the LFY PWM with dependencies as published previously [68] using an in-house script available on our GitHub page.
The receiver operating characteristics plot was then created with the R package plotROC v.2.2.1 (ref.
[69] ).
**LFY in dLUBS within LFY–UFO-specific regions versus LFY in** **LFY-specific regions.
**
To assess whether the scores of LFYBS within dLUBS were comparable to the scores of canonical LFYBS, we used the peaks from the comparison of LFY versus LFY–UFO ampDAP-seq and resized them (±50 bp around the peak maximum).
We used the dLUBS matrix to scan the resized sequences and retained the best site per sequence.
We then retrieved sequences corresponding to the dLUBS site and computed the score of the LFYBS present in dLUBS using the LFY PWM
[68] .
The values obtained in the 20% most LFY–UFO-specific sequences (20% highest CFC) are shown in the box plot.
The 20% lowest CFC peaks were scanned with the LFY PWM to generate the box plot in Extended Data Fig.
4f.
**Microarray data analysis.
** Microarray data were retrieved from AtGenExpress
[70] for inflorescence tissue in the _ufo_ background (ATGE_52A-C) versus the Col-0 background (ATGE_29A-C).
The R package gcrma [71] was used to adjust probe intensities and convert them to expression measures, and then the limma package [72] was used to fit the model and smooth standard errors.
A Benjamini–Hochberg correction was applied to the _P_ values, and fold change (FC) was computed as the ratio between expression in the WT and that in the _ufo_ mutant.
Only genes with |log 2 (FC)| > 0.5 and adjusted _P_ < 0.05 were considered as significantly differentially expressed.
**ChIP-seq datasets and analysis of ChIP-seq versus ampDAP-seq.
**
We collected the raw data of all available LFY ChIP-seq datasets: GSE141704 (ref.
[73] ), GSE96806 (ref.
[25] ), GSE64245 (ref.
[26] ) and GSE24568 (ref.
[68] ).
Mapping and peak-calling analysis were performed with the same procedure as for ampDAP-seq, except that the peaks were resized to 600 bp around the peak maximum, and the q option of MACS2 was set to 0.1.
Coverage of the resulting peaks was calculated as the average of the normalized read coverage for each replicate.
Peaks from the four datasets were merged through a four-way comparison following the    same procedure used for ampDAP-seq.
Bedtools intersect (v.2.30.0)
[74] was used with the options wa; f, 0.8; F, 0.8; and e to find the peaks common to the merged ChIP-seq peaks and the 20% most LFY–UFO-specific genomic regions (the highest CFC value from ampDAP-seq).
The peaks were assigned to genes by extending gene regions 3 kb upstream of the transcription start site and 1 kb downstream of the transcription termination site and using bedtools intersect (options f, 0.8; F, 0.8; e).
The bound genes obtained were crossed with the list of differentially expressed genes in _ufo_ inflorescences.
**Identification of the URM from published LFY ChIP-seq data.
**
To test whether the URM could be identified de novo (Extended Data Fig.
4g), we collected the 298 regions bound by LFY ChIP-seq data from inflorescence tissue
[25] for which the binding intensity was twice greater in vivo relative to in vitro (LFY ampDAP-seq).
We resized these regions to ±55 bp around the ChIP-seq peak maximum.
The corresponding sequences were searched with the LFY PWM
[68] to identify all LFYBS with a PWM score greater than −23.
Assuming that a recruiting motif should be at a fixed distance from the LFYBS, we created 140 batches, corresponding to sequences with sizes ranging from 4 to 10 bp, distant from 1 to 20 bp at both sides of the canonical LFYBS.
Each of the 140 batches of sequences was used as input with MEME-ChIP for motif discovery with the motif size constrained to the length of the sequences in a given batch.
**Statistics and reproducibility**
All DLRA data were analysed using RStudio software [75] and are presented as mean ± s.d.
All statistical methods are indicated in the figure legends.
One-way ANOVA was used to analyse experimental data with more than two experimental groups (with two-sided Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests).
Welch’s ANOVA was performed when the homogeneity-of-variance assumption was not met (with two-sided Games–Howell post hoc tests).
For Fig.
1a,b, the strong promoter activation by 3xHA–LFY–VP16 + UFO–3xFLAG skewed the model and did not allow us to analyse other differences; a log-transformation was applied to the data before performing ANOVA.
Two-tailed unpaired Student’s _t_ -tests were used for the other data analyses.
For the GUS experiments and plant complementation assays, two-sided _χ_
[2] tests were used to test for independency between constructs and measured phenotypes.
The raw data and exact _P_ values are provided in the Source data files as well as the number of independent repetitions for each experiment.

Drawings represent the different types of complexes involving LFY-DBD (pale blue) and ASK1-UFO (red) on DNA.
LFY-DBD binds as a monomer as previously reported [29] .
The fact that _in vitro_ produced UFO-3xFLAG shifts DNA in the presence of LFY indicates that ASK1 is not required for the UFO-LFY-DNA complex formation _in vitro_ .
